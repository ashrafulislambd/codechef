There are $N$ problems in this contest; each problem has a unique problem code between $1$ and $N$ inclusive. Appy and Chef decided to split the problems to solve between them \u2015 Appy should solve the problems whose problem codes are divisible by $A$ but not divisible by $B$, and Chef should solve the problems whose problem codes are divisible by $B$ but not divisible by $A$ (they decided to not solve the problems whose codes are divisible by both $A$ and $B$).\n\nTo win, it is necessary to solve at least $K$ problems. You have to tell Appy whether they are going to win or lose.\n\n### Input\n- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.\n- The first and only line of each test case contains four space-separated integers $N$, $A$, $B$ and $K$.\n\n### Output\nFor each test case, print a single line containing the string `\"Win\"` if they can solve at least $K$ problems or `\"Lose\"` otherwise (without quotes).\n\n### Constraints \n- $1 \\le T \\le 15$\n- $1 \\le K \\le N \\le 10^{18}$\n- $1 \\le A, B \\le 10^9$\n\n### Subtasks\n**Subtask #1 (15 points):**\n- $1 \\le T \\le 15$\n- $1 \\le K \\le N \\le 10^6$\n- $1 \\le A, B \\le 10^3$\n\n**Subtask #2 (85 points):** original constraints\n\n### Example Input\n```\n1\n6 2 3 3\n```\n\n### Example Output\n```\nWin\n```\n\n### Explanation\n**Example case 1:** Appy is solving the problems with codes $2$ and $4$, Chef is solving the problem with code $3$. Nobody is solving problem $6$, since $6$ is divisible by both $2$ and $3$. Therefore, they can solve $3$ problems and win.\n","languages_supported":"C, CPP14, JAVA, PYTH, PYTH 3.6, PYPY, CS2, PAS fpc, PAS gpc, RUBY, PHP, GO, NODEJS, HASK, rust, SCALA, swift, D, PERL, FORT, WSPC, ADA, CAML, ICK, BF, ASM, CLPS, PRLG, ICON, SCM qobi, PIKE, ST, NICE, LUA, BASH, NEM, LISP sbcl, LISP clisp, SCM guile, JS, ERL, TCL, kotlin, PERL6, TEXT, SCM chicken, PYP3, CLOJ, COB, FS","max_timelimit":"1","source_sizelimit":"50000","problem_author":"hmrockstar","problem_author_html_handle":"<span \n            class='rating' \n            style='display: inline-block; \n                    font-size: 10px; \n                    background: #3366CC;\n                    padding: 0 3px; \n                    line-height: 1.3; \n                    color: white;\n                    margin-right: 2px;'>3&#9733;<\/span><span>hmrockstar<\/span>","problem_tester":null,"problem_tester_html_handle":"","date_added":"25-01-2019","tags":"<a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/cakewalk'>cakewalk<\/a>, <a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/feb19'>feb19<\/a>, <a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/gcd'>gcd<\/a>, <a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/hmrockstar'>hmrockstar<\/a>, <a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/maths'>maths<\/a>","editorial_url":"https:\/\/discuss.codechef.com\/problems\/HMAPPY2","time":{"view_start_date":1550050202,"submit_start_date":1550050202,"visible_start_date":1550050202,"end_date":1735669800,"current":1559472926},"user":{"username":"","access":"default"},"todo":false,"problem_status":"unattempted","is_direct_submittable":false}

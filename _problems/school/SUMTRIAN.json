Each test case starts with the number of lines which is followed by their content.\n<h3>Output<\/h3>\n<p>\nFor each test case write the determined value in a separate line. \n\n<h3>Example<\/h3>\n\n<pre>\n<b>Input:<\/b>\n2\n3\n1\n2 1\n1 2 3\n4 \n1 \n1 2 \n4 1 2\n2 3 1 1 \n\n<b>Output:<\/b>\n5\n9\n<\/pre>\n<br\/>\n<b>Warning: large Input\/Output data, be careful with certain languages<\/b> ","languages_supported":"ADA, ASM, BASH, BF, C, C99 strict, CAML, CLOJ, CLPS, CPP 4.3.2, CPP 4.9.2, CPP14, CS2, D, ERL, FORT, FS, GO, HASK, ICK, ICON, JAVA, JS, LISP clisp, LISP sbcl, LUA, NEM, NICE, NODEJS, PAS fpc, PAS gpc, PERL, PHP, PIKE, PRLG, PYPY, PYTH, PYTH 3.4, RUBY, SCALA, SCM chicken, SCM guile, SCM qobi, ST, TCL, TEXT, WSPC","max_timelimit":"3","source_sizelimit":"5000","problem_author":"admin","problem_author_html_handle":"admin","problem_tester":null,"problem_tester_html_handle":"","date_added":"1-12-2008","tags":"<a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/admin'>\n                    admin\n                <\/a>","user":{"username":null},"time":{"view_start_date":1235621211,"submit_start_date":1235621211,"visible_start_date":1235621211,"end_date":1735669800,"current":1492507641},"todo":false,"problem_status":"unattempted"}

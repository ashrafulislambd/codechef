Predicting difficulty levels of the problems can be a daunting task. Chef wants his contests to be balanced in terms of difficulty levels of the problems.<\/p>\n\n<p>Assume a contest had total <b>P<\/b> participants. A problem that was solved by at least half of the participants (i.e. <b>P \/ 2<\/b> (integer division)) is said to be cakewalk difficulty. A problem solved by at max <b>P \/ 10<\/b> (integer division) participants is categorized to be a hard difficulty.<\/p>\n\n<p>Chef wants the contest to be balanced. According to him, a balanced contest must have exactly 1 cakewalk and exactly 2 hard problems. You are given the description of <b>N<\/b> problems and the number of participants solving those problems. Can you tell whether the contest was balanced or not?<\/p>\n\n<h3>Input<\/h3>\n<p>The first line of the input contains an integer <b>T<\/b> denoting the number of test cases.<\/p>\n<p>The first line of each test case contains two space separated integers, <b>N, P<\/b> denoting the number of problems, number of participants respectively.<\/p>\n<p>The second line contains <b>N<\/b> space separated integers, <b>i<\/b>-th of which denotes number of participants solving the <b>i<\/b>-th problem.<\/p>\n\n<h3>Output<\/h3>\n<p>For each test case, output \"yes\" or \"no\" (without quotes) denoting whether the contest is balanced or not.<\/p>\n\n<h3>Constraints<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>1 \u2264 <b>T, N<\/b> \u2264 500 <\/li>\n<li>1 \u2264 <b>P<\/b> \u2264 10<sup>8<\/sup> <\/li>\n<li>1 \u2264 Number of participants solving a problem \u2264 <b>P<\/b><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<h3>Subtasks<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Subtask #1<\/b> (40 points): <b>P<\/b> is a multiple of 10<\/li>\n<li><b>Subtask #2<\/b> (60 points): Original constraints<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<h3>Example<\/h3>\n<pre>\n<b>Input<\/b>\n6\n3 100\n10 1 100\n3 100\n11 1 100\n3 100\n10 1 10\n3 100\n10 1 50\n4 100\n50 50 50 50\n4 100\n1 1 1 1\n\n<b>Output<\/b>\nyes\nno\nno\nyes\nno\nno\n<\/pre>\n\n<h3>Explanation<\/h3>\n<p><b>Example case 1.<\/b>: The problems are of hard, hard and cakewalk difficulty.

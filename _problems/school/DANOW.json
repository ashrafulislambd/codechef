Missandei, her advisor and Handmaiden, keeps the log of each battle and the amount and strength of soldiers won in a battle. \n\nNow, Danny has some questions for Missandei in which she asks the strength of the army gained during some battles. She will ask the query of the form $L, R$ and Missandei has to tell the strength gained in between the $L$ and $R$ battles. Help Missandei. \n\nYou are given an array $A$, where $A[i]$ represents the number of soldiers won in $i^{th}$ battle and the strength of a soldier who won in $i^{th}$ battle is given in another array $B[i]$. ( $B[i]$ represents the strength of each soldier who won in the $i^{th}$ battle). \n\n###Input:\n\n- First line will contain $N$ and $Q$, number of battles fought and number of queries. \n- Next line contains $N$ space separated integers denoting the array $A$.\n- Next line contains $N$ space separated integers denoting the array $B$.\n- Next $Q$ lines contain two integers $L$ and $R$.\n\n###Output:\nFor each query, output the strength gained in between the $L$ and $R$ battles (both inclusive).\n\n###Constraints \n- $1 \\leq N, Q \\leq 1000$\n- $0 \\leq A[i] \\leq 10^6$\n- $0 \\leq B[i] \\leq 10^6$\n- $1 \\leq L \\leq R \\leq N$\n\n###Sample Input:\n\t5 3\n\t2 3 1 6 5\n\t1 2 3 4 5\n\t2 3\n\t1 1\n\t1 5\n###Sample Output:\n\t9\n\t2\n\t60\n###EXPLANATION:\nFor the first query, strength gained in $2^{nd}$ battle is $2*3 = 6$ and in $3^{rd}$ battle is $3*1 = 3$. Total = $6 + 3 = 9$.\n","languages_supported":"C, CPP14, JAVA, PYTH, PYTH 3.6, PYPY, CS2, PAS fpc, PAS gpc, RUBY, PHP, GO, NODEJS, HASK, rust, SCALA, swift, D, PERL, FORT, WSPC, ADA, CAML, ICK, BF, ASM, CLPS, PRLG, ICON, SCM qobi, PIKE, ST, NICE, LUA, BASH, NEM, LISP sbcl, LISP clisp, SCM guile, JS, ERL, TCL, kotlin, PERL6, TEXT, SCM chicken, PYP3, CLOJ, R, COB, FS","max_timelimit":"1","source_sizelimit":"50000","problem_author":"aashu_k","problem_author_html_handle":"<span \n            class='rating' \n            style='display: inline-block; \n                    font-size: 10px; \n                    background: #684273;\n                    padding: 0 3px; \n                    line-height: 1.3; \n                    color: white;\n                    margin-right: 2px;'>4&#9733;<\/span><span>aashu_k<\/span>","problem_tester":null,"problem_tester_html_handle":"","date_added":"5-04-2019","tags":"<a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/aashu_k'>aashu_k<\/a>","time":{"view_start_date":1554669000,"submit_start_date":1554669000,"visible_start_date":1554669000,"end_date":1735669800,"current":1559472925},"user":{"username":"","access":"default"},"todo":false,"problem_status":"unattempted","is_direct_submittable":false}

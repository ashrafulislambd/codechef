All submissions for this problem are available.Problem description.

Chef recently had been studying about Fibonacci numbers and wrote a code to print out the kth term of the Fibonacci series(1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13….). He was wondering whether he could write a program to generate the **kth** term for similar series. More specifically : **T(n, k) is 1 if n k** . Given n and k output **T(n, k)%(1000000007)** as the answer could be very large ### Input

Two integers, **N** and **K**### Output

Output description.

One integer, the nth term of the series mod 1000000007 ### Constraints

19. **1** ≤ **N, K** ≤ **2\*105**
### Example

<pre><b>Input:</b>
7 5

<b>Output:</b>
9
<p> </p>
<h3>Explanation</h3>
<p><b>Example case 1. The series is as follows {1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 9}</b></p>

All submissions for this problem are available.Chef is making polygon cakes in his kitchen today! Since the judge panel is very strict, Chef's cakes must be beautiful and have sharp and precise $internal$ angles in arithmetic progression. Given the number of sides, $N$, of the cake Chef is baking today and also the measure of its first angle(smallest angle), $A$, find the measure of the $K^{th}$ angle. ###Input: - The first line contains a single integer $T$, the number of test cases. - The next $T$ lines contain three space separated integers $N$, $A$ and $K$, the number of sides of polygon, the first angle and the $K^{th}$ angle respectively. ###Output: For each test case, print two space separated integers $X$ and $Y$, such that the $K^{th}$ angle can be written in the form of $X/Y$ and $gcd(X, Y) = 1$ ###Constraints - $1 \\leq T \\leq 50$ - $3 \\leq N \\leq 1000$ - $1 \\leq A \\leq 1000000000$ - $1 \\leq K \\leq N$ - It is guaranteed the answer is always valid. ###Sample Input: 1 3 30 2 ###Sample Output: 60 1

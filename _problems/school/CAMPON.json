Jafar wants to participate in the camp, but guess what? His coach is Yalalovichik.\n\nYalalovichik is a legendary coach, famous in the history of competitive programming. However, he is only willing to send to the camp students who solve really hard problems on Timus. He started a marathon at the beginning of December. Initially, he said that people who solve 200 or more problems by the 31-st of December may go to the camp. Jafar made a schedule for the next month. For each day, he knows how many problems he is going to solve.\n\nThe problem is that Yalalovichik is a really moody coach \u2014 he may wake up tomorrow and change his decision about the deadline and the number of problems that must be solved by this deadline to qualify for the camp. Jafar has $Q$ such scenarios. Now he wants to know: in each scenario, if he does not change his problem solving schedule, will he go to the camp or not?\n\n### Input\n- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.\n- The first line of each test case contains a single integer $D$ - the number of days in Jafar's schedule.\n- $D$ lines follow. For each $i$ ($1 \\le i \\le D$), the $i$-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers $d_i$ and $p_i$ denoting that Jafar will solve $p_i$ problems on day $d_i$.\n- The next line contains a single integer $Q$ denoting the number of scenarios Jafar considers.\n- $Q$ lines follow. For each $i$ ($1 \\le i \\le Q$), the $i$-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers $dead_i$ and $req_i$ denoting a scenario where Yalaovichik decides that students who solve $req_i$ problems by day $dead_i$ (inclusive) will go to the camp.\n\n### Output\nFor each scenario, print a single line containing the string `\"Go Camp\"` if Jafar is going to the camp or `\"Go Sleep\"` otherwise (without quotes).\n\n### Constraints \n- $1 \\le T \\le 100$\n- $1 \\le D \\le 31$\n- $1 \\le d_i \\le 31$ for each valid $i$\n- $1 \\le p_i \\le 100$ for each valid $i$\n- $d_1, d_2, \\ldots, d_D$ are pairwise distinct\n- $1 \\le Q \\le 100$\n- $1 \\le dead_i \\le 31$ for each valid $i$\n- $1 \\le req_i \\le 5,000$ for each valid $i$\n\n### Example Input\n```\n1\n3\n10 5\n14 4\n31 1\n2\n9 2\n15 7\n```\n\n### Example Output\n```\nGo Sleep\nGo Camp\n```\n\t\n### Explanation\n**Example case 1:**\n- By the end of day $9$, Jafar will not have any problem solved.\n- By the end of day $15$, Jafar will have $9$ problems solved, which is enough to go to the camp, since he needs at least $7$ problems.\n","languages_supported":"C, CPP14, JAVA, PYTH, PYTH 3.6, PYPY, CS2, PAS fpc, PAS gpc, RUBY, PHP, GO, NODEJS, HASK, rust, SCALA, swift, D, PERL, FORT, WSPC, ADA, CAML, ICK, BF, ASM, CLPS, PRLG, ICON, SCM qobi, PIKE, ST, NICE, LUA, BASH, NEM, LISP sbcl, LISP clisp, SCM guile, JS, ERL, TCL, kotlin, PERL6, TEXT, SCM chicken, PYP3, CLOJ, COB, FS","max_timelimit":"1","source_sizelimit":"50000","problem_author":"deadwing97","problem_author_html_handle":"<span \n            class='rating' \n            style='display: inline-block; \n                    font-size: 10px; \n                    background: #3366CC;\n                    padding: 0 3px; \n                    line-height: 1.3; \n                    color: white;\n                    margin-right: 2px;'>3&#9733;<\/span><span>deadwing97<\/span>","problem_tester":null,"problem_tester_html_handle":"","date_added":"19-12-2018","tags":"<a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/cook101'>cook101<\/a>, <a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/deadwing97'>deadwing97<\/a>","editorial_url":"https:\/\/discuss.codechef.com\/problems\/CAMPON","time":{"view_start_date":1545589802,"submit_start_date":1545589802,"visible_start_date":1545589802,"end_date":1735669800,"current":1559472924},"user":{"username":"","access":"default"},"todo":false,"problem_status":"unattempted","is_direct_submittable":false}

He has participated in many cooking competitions in the past \u2014 so many that he does not even remember them all.\n\nOne of these competitions lasted for a certain number of days. The first day of the competition was day $S$ of the week (i.e. Monday, Tuesday etc.) and the last day was day $E$ of the week. Chef remembers that the duration of the competition (the number of days between the first and last day, inclusive) was between $L$ days and $R$ days inclusive. Is it possible to uniquely determine the exact duration of the competition? If so, what is this duration?\n\n### Input\n- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.\n- The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated strings $S$ and $E$, followed by a space and two space-separated integers $L$ and $R$.\n\n### Output\nFor each test case, print a single line containing:\n- the string `\"impossible\"` if there is no duration consistent with all given information\n- the string `\"many\"` if there is more than one possible duration\n- one integer \u2014 the duration of the competition, if its duration is unique\n\n### Constraints \n- $1 \\le T \\le 10,000$\n- $1 \\le L \\le R \\le 100$\n- $S$ is one of the strings \"saturday\", \"sunday\", \"monday\", \"tuesday\", \"wednesday\", \"thursday\" or \"friday\"\n- $E$ is one of the strings \"saturday\", \"sunday\", \"monday\", \"tuesday\", \"wednesday\", \"thursday\" or \"friday\"\n\n### Subtasks\n**Subtask #1 (100 points):** original constraints\n\n### Example Input\n```\n3\nsaturday sunday 2 4\nmonday wednesday 1 20\nsaturday sunday 3 5\n```\n\n### Example Output\n```\n2\nmany\nimpossible\n```\n","languages_supported":"C, CPP14, JAVA, PYTH, PYTH 3.6, PYPY, CS2, PAS fpc, PAS gpc, RUBY, PHP, GO, NODEJS, HASK, rust, SCALA, swift, D, PERL, FORT, WSPC, ADA, CAML, ICK, BF, ASM, CLPS, PRLG, ICON, SCM qobi, PIKE, ST, NICE, LUA, BASH, NEM, LISP sbcl, LISP clisp, SCM guile, JS, ERL, TCL, kotlin, PERL6, TEXT, SCM chicken, PYP3, CLOJ, COB, FS","max_timelimit":"1","source_sizelimit":"50000","problem_author":"kingofnumbers","problem_author_html_handle":"<span \n            class='rating' \n            style='display: inline-block; \n                    font-size: 10px; \n                    background: #FF7F00;\n                    padding: 0 3px; \n                    line-height: 1.3; \n                    color: white;\n                    margin-right: 2px;'>6&#9733;<\/span><span>kingofnumbers<\/span>","problem_tester":null,"problem_tester_html_handle":"","date_added":"23-11-2018","tags":"<a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/cakewalk'>cakewalk<\/a>, <a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/implementation'>implementation<\/a>, <a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/kingofnumbers'>kingofnumbers<\/a>, <a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/ltime66'>ltime66<\/a>","editorial_url":"https:\/\/discuss.codechef.com\/problems\/EVENT","time":{"view_start_date":1543078801,"submit_start_date":1543078801,"visible_start_date":1543078801,"end_date":1735669800,"current":1559472926},"user":{"username":"","access":"default"},"todo":false,"problem_status":"unattempted","is_direct_submittable":false}

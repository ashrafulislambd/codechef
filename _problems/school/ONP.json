For instance, to add three and four, one would write \"3 4 +\" rather than \"3 + 4\". If there are multiple operations, the operator is given immediately after its second operand; so the expression written \"3 \u2212 4 + 5\" would be written \"3 4 \u2212 5 +\" first subtract 4 from 3, then add 5 to that.<\/p>\n\n<p>\nTransform the algebraic expression with brackets into RPN form. \n<\/p>\n<p>\nYou can assume that for the test cases below only single letters will be used, brackets [] will not be used and each expression has only one RPN form (no expressions like a*b*c)\n\n<\/p>\n<h3>Input<\/h3>\n\n<p align=\"left\">\nThe first line contains t, the number of test cases (less then 100).\n<\/p>\n<p>\nFollowed by t lines, containing an expression to be translated to RPN form, where the length of the expression is less then 400.\n<\/p>\n\n<h3>Output<\/h3>\n<PRE>\nThe <em>expression<\/em>s in RPN form, one per line.\n<\/pre>\n<h3>Example<\/h3>\n\n<PRE>\nInput:\n3\n(a+(b*c))\n((a+b)*(z+x))\n((a+t)*((b+(a+c))^(c+d)))\n\nOutput:\nabc*+\nab+zx+*\nat+bac++cd+^*\n<\/pre>","languages_supported":"ADA, ASM, BASH, BF, C, C99 strict, CAML, CLPS, CPP 4.3.2, CPP 4.9.2, CPP14, CS2, D, ERL, FORT, GO, HASK, ICK, ICON, JAVA, JS, LISP clisp, LISP sbcl, LUA, NEM, NICE, NODEJS, PAS fpc, PAS gpc, PERL, PHP, PIKE, PRLG, PYTH, PYTH 3.4, RUBY, SCALA, SCM guile, SCM qobi, ST, TEXT, WSPC","max_timelimit":"5","source_sizelimit":"50000","problem_author":"admin","problem_author_html_handle":"admin","problem_tester":null,"problem_tester_html_handle":null,"date_added":"1-12-2008","tags":"<a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/admin'>\n                    admin\n                <\/a>","user":{"username":null},"time":{"view_start_date":1232460231,"submit_start_date":1232460231,"visible_start_date":1232460231,"end_date":1735669800,"current":1492507635},"todo":false,"problem_status":"unattempted"}

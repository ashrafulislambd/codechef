Your first mission is to implement a feature that will determine the number of submissions that were judged late in a contest.\n\nThere are $N$ submissions, numbered $1$ through $N$. For each valid $i$, the $i$-th submission was submitted at time $S_i$ and judged at time $J_i$ (in minutes). Submitting and judging both take zero time. Please determine how many submissions received their verdicts after a delay of more than $5$ minutes.\n\n### Input\n- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.\n- The first line of the input contains a single integer $N$.\n- $N$ lines follow. For each valid $i$, the $i$-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers $S_i$ and $J_i$.\n\n### Output\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \u2014 the number of submissions for which the judging was delayed by more than 5 minutes.\n\n### Constraints \n- $1 \\le T \\le 100$\n- $1 \\le N \\le 100$\n- $1 \\le S_i \\le J_i \\le 300$ for each valid $i$\n\n### Subtasks\n**Subtask #1 (100 points):** original constraints\n\n### Example Input\n```\n1\n5\n1 3\n4 4\n4 10\n1 11\n2 7\n```\n\n### Example Output\n```\n2\n```\n\t\n### Explanation\n**Example case 1:** The delays of the respective submissions are $2$ minutes, $0$ minutes, $6$ minutes, $10$ minutes and $5$ minutes. Only submissions $3$ and $4$ are delayed by more than $5$ minutes, hence the answer is $2$.\n","languages_supported":"C, CPP14, JAVA, PYTH, PYTH 3.6, PYPY, CS2, PAS fpc, PAS gpc, RUBY, PHP, GO, NODEJS, HASK, rust, SCALA, swift, D, PERL, FORT, WSPC, ADA, CAML, ICK, BF, ASM, CLPS, PRLG, ICON, SCM qobi, PIKE, ST, NICE, LUA, BASH, NEM, LISP sbcl, LISP clisp, SCM guile, JS, ERL, TCL, kotlin, PERL6, TEXT, SCM chicken, PYP3, CLOJ, COB, FS","max_timelimit":"1","source_sizelimit":"50000","problem_author":"kingofnumbers","problem_author_html_handle":"<span \n            class='rating' \n            style='display: inline-block; \n                    font-size: 10px; \n                    background: #FF7F00;\n                    padding: 0 3px; \n                    line-height: 1.3; \n                    color: white;\n                    margin-right: 2px;'>6&#9733;<\/span><span>kingofnumbers<\/span>","problem_tester":null,"problem_tester_html_handle":"","date_added":"28-09-2018","tags":"<a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/cakewalk'>cakewalk<\/a>, <a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/kingofnumbers'>kingofnumbers<\/a>, <a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/ltime64'>ltime64<\/a>, <a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/simulation'>simulation<\/a>, <a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/taran_1407'>taran_1407<\/a>","editorial_url":"https:\/\/discuss.codechef.com\/problems\/JDELAY","time":{"view_start_date":1538240402,"submit_start_date":1538240402,"visible_start_date":1538240402,"end_date":1735669800,"current":1559472927},"user":{"username":"","access":"default"},"todo":false,"problem_status":"unattempted","is_direct_submittable":false}

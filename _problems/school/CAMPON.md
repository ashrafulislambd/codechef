The Petrozavodsk camp takes place in about one month. Jafar wants to participate in the camp, but guess what? His coach is Yalalovichik. Yalalovichik is a legendary coach, famous in the history of competitive programming. However, he is only willing to send to the camp students who solve really hard problems on Timus. He started a marathon at the beginning of December. Initially, he said that people who solve 200 or more problems by the 31-st of December may go to the camp. Jafar made a schedule for the next month. For each day, he knows how many problems he is going to solve. The problem is that Yalalovichik is a really moody coach â€” he may wake up tomorrow and change his decision about the deadline and the number of problems that must be solved by this deadline to qualify for the camp. Jafar has $Q$ such scenarios. Now he wants to know: in each scenario, if he does not change his problem solving schedule, will he go to the camp or not? ### Input - The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows. - The first line of each test case contains a single integer $D$ - the number of days in Jafar's schedule. - $D$ lines follow. For each $i$ ($1 \\le i \\le D$), the $i$-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers $d\_i$ and $p\_i$ denoting that Jafar will solve $p\_i$ problems on day $d\_i$. - The next line contains a single integer $Q$ denoting the number of scenarios Jafar considers. - $Q$ lines follow. For each $i$ ($1 \\le i \\le Q$), the $i$-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers $dead\_i$ and $req\_i$ denoting a scenario where Yalaovichik decides that students who solve $req\_i$ problems by day $dead\_i$ (inclusive) will go to the camp. ### Output For each scenario, print a single line containing the string `"Go Camp"` if Jafar is going to the camp or `"Go Sleep"` otherwise (without quotes). ### Constraints - $1 \\le T \\le 100$ - $1 \\le D \\le 31$ - $1 \\le d\_i \\le 31$ for each valid $i$ - $1 \\le p\_i \\le 100$ for each valid $i$ - $d\_1, d\_2, \\ldots, d\_D$ are pairwise distinct - $1 \\le Q \\le 100$ - $1 \\le dead\_i \\le 31$ for each valid $i$ - $1 \\le req\_i \\le 5,000$ for each valid $i$ ### Example Input ``` 1 3 10 5 14 4 31 1 2 9 2 15 7 ``` ### Example Output ``` Go Sleep Go Camp ``` ### Explanation \*\*Example case 1:\*\* - By the end of day $9$, Jafar will not have any problem solved. - By the end of day $15$, Jafar will have $9$ problems solved, which is enough to go to the camp, since he needs at least $7$ problems.

For each person in the team, you know their scores in three skills - hard work, intelligence and persistence.<\/p>\n\n<p>You want to check whether it is possible to order these people (assign them numbers from 1 to 3) in such a way that for each <b>1 \u2264 i \u2264 2<\/b>, <b>i+1<\/b>-th person is stricly <em>better<\/em> than the <b>i<\/b>-th person.<\/p>\n\n<p>A person <b>x<\/b> is said to be <em>better<\/em> than another person <b>y<\/b> if <b>x<\/b> doesn't score less than <b>y<\/b> in any of the skills and scores more than <b>y<\/b> in at least one skill.<\/p>\n\n<p>Determine whether such an ordering exists.<\/p>\n\n<h3>Input<\/h3>\n<p>The first line fo the input contains an integer <b>T<\/b> denoting the number of test cases.<\/p>\n<p>Each test consists of three lines. Each of these lines contains three space separated integers <b>s<sub>1<\/sub>, s<sub>2<\/sub><\/b> and <b>s<sub>3<\/sub><\/b> denoting the scores of one member of the team in each of the three skills, in the given order.<\/p>\n\n<h3>Output<\/h3>\n<p>For each test case, output a single line containing \"yes\" if such an ordering exists or \"no\" if doesn't exist (without quotes).\n\n<h3>Constraints<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1 \u2264 T \u2264 1000<\/b><\/li>\n<li><b>1 \u2264 s<sub>1<\/sub>, s<sub>2<\/sub>, s<sub>3<\/sub> \u2264 100<\/b><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<h3>Example<\/h3>\n<pre>\n<b>Input<\/b>\n3\n1 2 3\n2 3 4\n2 3 5\n1 2 3\n2 3 4\n2 3 4\n5 6 5\n1 2 3\n2 3 4\n\n<b>Output<\/b>\nyes\nno\nyes\n<\/pre>\n\n<h3>Explanation<\/h3>\n<p><b>Test Case 1<\/b>: We can order them as (3, 2, 1). Person 3 is <i>better<\/i> than Person 2 because his scores in the first two skills are not lesser than Person 2's. And in skill 3, Person 3 scores higher. Similarly, Person 2 is <i>better<\/i> than Person 1. He scores more than Person 1 in every skill, in fact.<\/p>","languages_supported":"C, CPP14, JAVA, PYTH, PYTH 3.5, PYPY","max_timelimit":"1","source_sizelimit":"50000","problem_author":"admin2","problem_author_html_handle":"admin2","problem_tester":null,"problem_tester_html_handle":"","date_added":"30-10-2017","tags":"<a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/acmind17'>acmind17<\/a>, <a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/admin2'>admin2<\/a>, <a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/simple'>simple<\/a>, <a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/sorting'>sorting<\/a>","time":{"view_start_date":1509900600,"submit_start_date":1509900600,"visible_start_date":1509900600,"end_date":1735669800,"current":1525454444},"user":{"username":""},"todo":false,"problem_status":"unattempted","is_direct_submittable":false}

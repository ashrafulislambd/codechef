There are two rounds (round A and round B) after the qualification round. From both of them, teams can qualify to the pre-elimination round. According to the rules, in each of these two rounds, teams are sorted in descending order by their score and each team with a score greater or equal to the score of the team at the $K=1500$-th place advances to the pre-elimination round (this means it is possible to have more than $K$ qualified teams from each round in the case of one or more ties after the $K$-th place).\n\nToday, the organizers ask you to count the number of teams which would qualify for the pre-elimination round from round A for a given value of $K$ (possibly different from $1500$). They provided the scores of all teams to you; you should ensure that all teams scoring at least as many points as the $K$-th team qualify.\n\n### Input\n- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.\n- The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $K$.\n- The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $S_1, S_2, \\dots, S_N$.\n\n### Output\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \u2014 the number of qualified teams.\n\n### Constraints \n- $1 \\le T \\le 1,000$\n- $1 \\le K \\le N \\le 10^5$\n- $1 \\le S_i \\le 10^9$ for each valid $i$\n- the sum of $N$ for all test cases does not exceed $10^6$\n\n### Example Input\n```\n2\n5 1\n3 5 2 4 5\n6 4\n6 5 4 3 2 1\n```\n\n### Example Output\n```\n2\n4\n```\n","languages_supported":"C, CPP14, JAVA, PYTH, PYTH 3.6, PYPY, CS2, PAS fpc, PAS gpc, RUBY, PHP, GO, NODEJS, HASK, rust, SCALA, swift, D, PERL, FORT, WSPC, ADA, CAML, ICK, BF, ASM, CLPS, PRLG, ICON, SCM qobi, PIKE, ST, NICE, LUA, BASH, NEM, LISP sbcl, LISP clisp, SCM guile, JS, ERL, TCL, kotlin, PERL6, TEXT, SCM chicken, PYP3, CLOJ, COB, FS","max_timelimit":"1","source_sizelimit":"50000","problem_author":"kingofnumbers","problem_author_html_handle":"<span \n            class='rating' \n            style='display: inline-block; \n                    font-size: 10px; \n                    background: #FF7F00;\n                    padding: 0 3px; \n                    line-height: 1.3; \n                    color: white;\n                    margin-right: 2px;'>6&#9733;<\/span><span>kingofnumbers<\/span>","problem_tester":null,"problem_tester_html_handle":"","date_added":"10-10-2018","tags":"<a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/cakewalk'>cakewalk<\/a>, <a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/kingofnumbers'>kingofnumbers<\/a>, <a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/snckql19'>snckql19<\/a>, <a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/sorting'>sorting<\/a>, <a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/taran_1407'>taran_1407<\/a>","editorial_url":"https:\/\/discuss.codechef.com\/problems\/QUALPREL","time":{"view_start_date":1539698400,"submit_start_date":1539698400,"visible_start_date":1539698400,"end_date":1735669800,"current":1559472930},"user":{"username":"","access":"default"},"todo":false,"problem_status":"unattempted","is_direct_submittable":false}

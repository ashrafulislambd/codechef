In her 10th birthday, she got two arrays as presents. Let\u2019s call them <b>A<\/b> and <b>B<\/b>. Both arrays have the same size <b>n<\/b> and contains integers between <b>0<\/b> to <b>30000<\/b>.<\/p>\n\n<p>Lajuk\u2019s hard-drive is almost full of presents and she barely has any space to keep the arrays. She discovered a brilliant function to merge the array into one:\n<pre>\n\nint encodeInteger(int x, int n){\n\tn = n&lt;&lt;(1&lt;&lt;(1&lt;&lt;(1&lt;&lt;1)));\n\tx = x | n;\n\treturn x;\n}\nvoid encodeArray(int *A, int *B, int n){\n\tfor(int i=0;i&lt;n;i++) {\n    \t    A[i] = encodeInteger(A[i], B[i]);\n\t}\n}\n<\/pre>\n<\/p>\n\n<p>Lajuk passed <b>A<\/b> and <b>B<\/b> into the encodeArray function. After that she discarded array <b>B<\/b> and saved the modified version of array <b>A<\/b> in the hard-drive. <\/p>\n\n<p>Now in her 15th birthday Lajuk wants to play with those arrays again. She found the modified version of array A in the hard-drive but she forgot how to recover the original arrays from it. Being upset, she asked for your help. Can you help her to recover the original arrays?<\/p>\n\n<h3>Input<\/h3>\n<p>The first line contains <b>T (1 \u2264 T \u2264 100)<\/b>, the number of test cases. The first line of each test cases contains <b>n (1 \u2264  n \u2264  10<sup>4<\/sup>)<\/b>, the size of the array. Next <b>n<\/b> line contains <b>n<\/b> integers denoting the modified array <b>A<\/b>.<\/p>\n\n<h3>Output<\/h3>\n<p>For each case print the case number in the first line. In the second line, print n integers denoting the original array <b>A<\/b>. In the third line print n integers denoting the array <b>B<\/b>. Two consecutive  integers should be separated by a single space.<\/p>\n\n<h3>Sample <\/h3>\n<pre>\n<b>Input<\/b>\n1\n4\n196613\n655370\n196620\n131079\n\n<b>Output<\/b>\nCase 1:\n5 10 12 7\n3 10 3 2\n<\/pre>\n\n\n\n","languages_supported":"C, CPP14, JAVA, PYTH, PYTH 3.4","max_timelimit":"2","source_sizelimit":"50000","problem_author":"kol_adm","problem_author_html_handle":"kol_adm","problem_tester":null,"problem_tester_html_handle":"","date_added":"21-12-2016","tags":"<a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/kol_adm'>\n                    kol_adm\n                <\/a>","user":{"username":null},"time":{"view_start_date":1482831600,"submit_start_date":1482831600,"visible_start_date":1482831600,"end_date":1735669800,"current":1492506692},"todo":false,"problem_status":"unattempted"}

His budget is $B$, so he cannot buy a tablet whose price is greater than $B$. Other than that, he only has one criterion \u2014 the area of the tablet's screen should be as large as possible. Of course, the screen of a tablet is always a rectangle.\n\nChef has visited some tablet shops and listed all of his options. In total, there are $N$ available tablets, numbered $1$ through $N$. For each valid $i$, the $i$-th tablet has width $W_i$, height $H_i$ and price $P_i$.\n\nHelp Chef choose a tablet which he should buy and find the area of such a tablet's screen, or determine that he cannot buy any tablet.\n\n### Input\n- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.\n- The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $B$.\n- $N$ lines follow. For each $i$ ($1 \\le i \\le N$), the $i$-th of these lines contains three space-separated integers $W_i$, $H_i$ and $P_i$.\n\n### Output\nFor each test case, print a single line. If Chef cannot buy any tablet, it should contain the string `\"no tablet\"` (without quotes). Otherwise, it should contain a single integer \u2014 the maximum area of the screen of a tablet Chef can buy.\n\n### Constraints \n- $1 \\le T \\le 100$\n- $1 \\le N \\le 100$\n- $1 \\le B \\le 1,000,000$\n- $1 \\le P_i \\le 1,000,000$ for each valid $i$\n- $1 \\le W_i, H_i \\le 10,000$ for each valid $i$\n\n### Example Input\n```\n3\n3 6\n3 4 4\n5 5 7\n5 2 5\n2 6\n3 6 8\n5 4 9\n1 10\n5 5 10\n```\n\n### Example Output\n```\n12\nno tablet\n25\n```\n\t\n### Explanation\n**Example case 1:** The first tablet (with screen area $3 \\cdot 4 = 12$) is the best option for Chef, since Chef cannot afford the second one and the third one has a smaller screen.\n\n**Example case 2:** Chef's budget is $6$, but all tablets have higher prices, so Chef cannot buy any tablet.\n\n**Example case 3:** The price of the only tablet is exactly equal to Chef's budget, so he is able to buy it.\n","languages_supported":"C, CPP14, JAVA, PYTH, PYTH 3.6, PYPY, CS2, PAS fpc, PAS gpc, RUBY, PHP, GO, NODEJS, HASK, rust, SCALA, swift, D, PERL, FORT, WSPC, ADA, CAML, ICK, BF, ASM, CLPS, PRLG, ICON, SCM qobi, PIKE, ST, NICE, LUA, BASH, NEM, LISP sbcl, LISP clisp, SCM guile, JS, ERL, TCL, kotlin, PERL6, TEXT, SCM chicken, PYP3, CLOJ, COB, FS","max_timelimit":"1","source_sizelimit":"50000","problem_author":"kingofnumbers","problem_author_html_handle":"<span \n            class='rating' \n            style='display: inline-block; \n                    font-size: 10px; \n                    background: #FF7F00;\n                    padding: 0 3px; \n                    line-height: 1.3; \n                    color: white;\n                    margin-right: 2px;'>6&#9733;<\/span><span>kingofnumbers<\/span>","problem_tester":null,"problem_tester_html_handle":"","date_added":"16-02-2019","tags":"<a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/ad-hoc'>ad-hoc<\/a>, <a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/cakewalk'>cakewalk<\/a>, <a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/cook103'>cook103<\/a>, <a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/implementation'>implementation<\/a>, <a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/kingofnumbers'>kingofnumbers<\/a>","editorial_url":"https:\/\/discuss.codechef.com\/problems\/TABLET","time":{"view_start_date":1550428202,"submit_start_date":1550428202,"visible_start_date":1550428202,"end_date":1735669800,"current":1559472931},"user":{"username":"","access":"default"},"todo":false,"problem_status":"unattempted","is_direct_submittable":false}

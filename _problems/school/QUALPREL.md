Snackdown 2019 is coming! There are two rounds (round A and round B) after the qualification round. From both of them, teams can qualify to the pre-elimination round. According to the rules, in each of these two rounds, teams are sorted in descending order by their score and each team with a score greater or equal to the score of the team at the $K=1500$-th place advances to the pre-elimination round (this means it is possible to have more than $K$ qualified teams from each round in the case of one or more ties after the $K$-th place). Today, the organizers ask you to count the number of teams which would qualify for the pre-elimination round from round A for a given value of $K$ (possibly different from $1500$). They provided the scores of all teams to you; you should ensure that all teams scoring at least as many points as the $K$-th team qualify. ### Input - The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows. - The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $K$. - The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $S\_1, S\_2, \\dots, S\_N$. ### Output For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€” the number of qualified teams. ### Constraints - $1 \\le T \\le 1,000$ - $1 \\le K \\le N \\le 10^5$ - $1 \\le S\_i \\le 10^9$ for each valid $i$ - the sum of $N$ for all test cases does not exceed $10^6$ ### Example Input ``` 2 5 1 3 5 2 4 5 6 4 6 5 4 3 2 1 ``` ### Example Output ``` 2 4 ```

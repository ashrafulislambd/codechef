{"category_name":"challenge","status":"success","problem_code":"BLOCKS","problem_name":"Block Tower","body":"<span class=\"solution-visible-txt\">All submissions for this problem are available.<\/span><p>Dave has several rectangular blocks with which he wishes to build a tower.  He may only\nplace a block on another if its base fits within the other's base with the edges parallel. \nSo he could place a block with a base of 1x9 on top of a block with a base of 2x9, but not on top of a block\nwith a base of 8x8.  Help Dave make the tower as tall as\npossible.  Blocks may be rotated by any multiple of 90 degrees about any axis.  Each block may only be used once, and you must use at least 3 blocks.<\/p>\n\n<h3>Input:<\/h3>\n<p>Input begins with an integer T (about 500), the number of test cases.  Each test case\nbegins with an integer N (chosen uniformly between 10 and 200, inclusive), the number of\nblocks.  N lines follow, each containing 3 integers that give the dimensions of a block.\nAll dimensions are chosen uniformly between 1 and 100, inclusive.  A blank line separates\neach case.<\/p>\n\n<h3>Output:<\/h3>\n<p>For each case, first ouput an integer P&gt;=3, indicating the number of blocks you wish to\nuse.  Follow with P lines, each containing the dimensions of a block, with the height of\nthe block listed first (the order of the other 2 dimensions does not matter).  Output\nthe blocks in order from the top of the tower to bottom of the tower.<\/p>\n\n<h3>Scoring<\/h3>\nYour score for each test case is the height of your tower divided by N.  Your total score\nis the average of your scores on the individual test cases.\n\n<h3>Sample input:<\/h3>\n<pre>1\n\n10\n7 2 10\n8 8 8\n7 1 1\n2 7 9\n6 8 1\n6 6 5\n3 2 5\n10 3 9\n10 10 8\n4 4 1<\/pre>\n\n\n<h3>Sample output:<\/h3>\n<pre>5\n4 1 4\n1 1 7\n10 2 7\n2 7 9\n8 10 10\n\n<\/pre>\n\n<p>Score: (4+1+10+2+8)\/10 = 2.5<\/p>","languages_supported":"C, CPP14, JAVA, PYTH, PYTH 3.5, PYPY, CS2, PAS fpc, PAS gpc, RUBY, PHP, GO, NODEJS, HASK, rust, SCALA, swift, D, PERL, FORT, WSPC, ADA, CAML, ICK, BF, ASM, CLPS, PRLG, ICON, SCM qobi, PIKE, ST, NICE, LUA, BASH, NEM, LISP sbcl, LISP clisp, SCM guile, JS, ERL, kotlin, PERL6, TEXT, SCM chicken, CLOJ, COB, FS","max_timelimit":"1.33","source_sizelimit":"50000","problem_author":"pieguy","problem_author_html_handle":"<span \n            class='rating' \n            style='display: inline-block; \n                    font-size: 10px; \n                    background: #FF7F00;\n                    padding: 0 3px; \n                    line-height: 1.3; \n                    color: white;\n                    margin-right: 2px;'>6&#9733;<\/span><span>pieguy<\/span>","problem_tester":"anshuman_singh","problem_tester_html_handle":"<span \n            class='rating' \n            style='display: inline-block; \n                    font-size: 10px; \n                    background: #684273;\n                    padding: 0 3px; \n                    line-height: 1.3; \n                    color: white;\n                    margin-right: 2px;'>4&#9733;<\/span><span>anshuman_singh<\/span>","date_added":"9-06-2010","tags":"<a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/challenge'>challenge<\/a>, <a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/july10'>july10<\/a>, <a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/pieguy'>pieguy<\/a>","editorial_url":"http:\/\/discuss.codechef.com\/problems\/BLOCKS","time":{"view_start_date":1278915452,"submit_start_date":1278915452,"visible_start_date":1278915520,"end_date":1735669800,"current":1525454414},"user":{"username":""},"todo":false,"problem_status":"unattempted","is_direct_submittable":false}

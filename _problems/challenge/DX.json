The box has a fixed size at the base, but we can choose its height. We would like to place all the balls within the box, and at the same time try to minimize its height.\n\n<h3>Input<\/h3>\n<\/p><p>First, 2 integers, 10 \u2264 a,b \u2264 100 - the dimensions of the rectangular base of the box. Then, an integer 1 \u2264 n \u2264 10000, representing the number of balls. The following  n  values 1 \u2264 r<sub>i<\/sub> \u2264 5 are the radii of the respective balls.\n\n<h3>Output<\/h3>\n<\/p><p>You should write to output n triples of floating-point numbers, the ith triple being the x,y, and z coordinates of the center of the ith ball.\n\n<\/p><p>If we want to be precise, the coordinates of the points written to output must fulfill the following constraints for the i-th point: \nx<sub>i<\/sub>-r<sub>i<\/sub> \u2265 0,\ny<sub>i<\/sub>-r<sub>i<\/sub> \u2265 0,\nz<sub>i<\/sub>-r<sub>i<\/sub> \u2265 0,\nx<sub>i<\/sub>+r<sub>i<\/sub> \u2264 a,\ny<sub>i<\/sub>+r<sub>i<\/sub> \u2264 b.

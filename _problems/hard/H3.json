He has even invented an interesting counting problem involving congruent triangles!<\/p>\n<p>Recall that two triangles are congruent if their corresponding sides are equal in length and their corresponding angles are equal in size. A lattice triangle is a triangle such that the coordinates of all its vertices are integers. Johnny's problem can now be described as follows:<\/p>\n<p>You are given an integer M and a lattice triangle ABC all of whose vertices (A, B, and C) are inside rectangle R<sub>M<\/sub>. R<sub>M<\/sub> is the rectangle having (0,0) as its bottom-left corner and (M,M) as its top-right corner. In other words, 0 \u2264\u00a0    x<sub>A<\/sub>, y<sub>A<\/sub>, x<sub>B<\/sub>, y<sub>B<\/sub>, x<sub>C<\/sub>, y<sub>C<\/sub> \u2264 M. The problem is to count the number of lattice triangles congruent to ABC also having all their vertices inside the rectangle R<sub>M<\/sub>.<\/p>\n<p>Could you help Johnny write a program to solve this problem?<\/p>\n<h3>Input<\/h3>\n<p>The first line contains t, the number of test cases (about 10). Then t test cases follow. Each test case has the following form:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The first line contains two numbers M and K (1\u2264     M \u2264    1000, 1\u2264     K     \u22641000). K is the number of given triangles.<\/li>\n<li>Each line in the next K lines contains 6 integers x<sub>A<\/sub>, y<sub>A<\/sub>, x<sub>B<\/sub>, y<sub>B<\/sub>, x<sub>C<\/sub>, y<sub>C<\/sub> (0 \u2264    x<sub>A<\/sub>, y<sub>A<\/sub>, x<sub>B<\/sub>, y<sub>B<\/sub>, x<sub>C<\/sub>, y<sub>C<\/sub>\u2264     M) describing a triangle ABC. It is guaranteed that ABC is always a triangle (i.e., non-degenerate).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The input for successive test cases is separated by a blank line.<\/p>\n<h3>Output<\/h3>\n<p>For each test case, output a line containing the string \"Case #T:\" where T should be replaced by the corresponding test case number.<\/p>\n<p>Then, K lines should follow, each line containing the number of triangles having vertices inside the rectangle R<sub>M<\/sub>, congruent to the corresponding triangle given in the input.<\/p>\n<p>Print a blank line after each test case.<\/p>\n<h3>Example<\/h3>\n<pre><b>Input:<\/b>\n2\n\n2 2\n0 0 0 2 2 0\n0 0 1 1 2 0\n\n3 2\n0 0 0 2 2 0\n0 0 1 1 2 0\n\n<b>Output:<\/b>\nCase #1:\n4\n8\n\nCase #2:\n16\n24\n<\/pre>\n<h3>Output details<\/h3>\n<p>The 8 triangles congruent to the second triangle (in the first test case) are presented in the following figure:<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"\/themes\/abessive\/images\/contests\/h3.png\" \/><\/p>    ","languages_supported":"NA","title":"H3","category":"NA","old_version":true,"problem_code":"H3"}

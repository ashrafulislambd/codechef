{"body":"\n<h3> All submissions for this problem are available. <\/h3><p>Johnny has been hired to write a program to analyse strategic data for the Bytelandian Navy. His task is described below.<\/p>\n<p>There are N battleships represented as N points on the plane. The <b>radius<\/b> of a ship is defined to be the distance from that ship to the ship closest to it. The <b>effective set<\/b> for a ship is defined to be the set of all ships (excluding itself) which are at a distance from that ship of <b>no more than twice<\/b> its radius. The number of elements in the effective set of a ship is called the <b>effective value<\/b> of that ship.<\/p>\n<p>Johnny needs to write a program to calculate the radius and the effective value of each battleship. This task is so tough that without your help, Johnny could never finish it. Let's help him!<\/p>\n<h3>Input<\/h3>\n<p>The first line contains t, the number of test cases (about 5). Then t test cases follow. Each test case has the following form:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The first line contains an integer N, the number of battleships (1 &lt; N &lt;= 30000).<\/li>\n<li>Each line in the next N lines contains two integers X, Y (0 &lt;= X, Y &lt;= 10000) represents the coordinates of a battleship.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Each test case's input is separated by a blank line. There may be more than one ships located at the same place.<\/p>\n<h3>Output<\/h3>\n<p>For each test case, print N lines. Each line should contain two numbers which are the radius and the effective value of the corresponding battleship. The radius should be rounded to 2 decimal points.<\/p>\n<p>Print a blank line after each test case's output.<\/p>\n<h3>Example<\/h3>\n<pre><b><\/b><b>Input<\/b><br \/>2<br \/><br \/>3<br \/>0 0<br \/>0 0<br \/>3 4<br \/><br \/>5<br \/>5 3<br \/>7 8<br \/>0 9<br \/>3 1<br \/>4 4<br \/><br \/><b>Output<\/b><br \/>0.00 1<br \/>0.00 1<br \/>5.00 2<br \/><br \/>1.41 2<br \/>5.00 4<br \/>6.40 4<br \/>2.83 2<br \/>1.41 1<br \/><\/pre>\n<p><\/p>    ","languages_supported":"NA","title":"J4","category":"NA","old_version":true,"problem_code":"J4"}

{"body":"\n<h3> All submissions for this problem are available. <\/h3><p align=\"justify\">In an N-dimensional grid the co-ordinates of a cell are denoted as X<sub>1<\/sub>, X<sub>2<\/sub>, ..., X<sub>N<\/sub>. Any cell with negative co-ordinate are colored white. The origin cell (the one with all zero co-ordinates) is colored as black. The color of a cell in (X<sub>1<\/sub>, X<sub>2<\/sub>, ..., X<sub>N<\/sub>) depends on the N cells with co-ordinates (X<sub>1<\/sub>-1, X<sub>2<\/sub>, ..., X<sub>N<\/sub>), (X<sub>1<\/sub>, X<sub>2<\/sub>-1, ..., X<sub>N<\/sub>), ....,  (X<sub>1<\/sub>, X<sub>2<\/sub>, ..., X<sub>N<\/sub>-1). The cell is colored white if and only if the number of black colored cells among these N co-ordinates are even, otherwise the cell is colored black.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">You are given the starting and ending co-ordinate of sub-hypercube. You need to compute how many hyper cells in this sub hypercube are colored black.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3>Input<\/h3>\n<p align=\"justify\">First line of the input contains T the number of test cases. Each test case starts with a line containing N the dimension of the hypercube. The second line contains N integers denoting the co-ordinate of the starting cell of the hypercube. The third line contains N integers denoting the co-ordinate of the ending cell of the hypercube.<\/p>\n\n<h3>Output<\/h3>\n<p align=\"justify\">For each test case, output the number of black colored cells in the given hypercube. Since the result can be too big so output the result modulo 1000000009.<\/p>\n\n<h3>Example<\/h3>\n<br \/>\n<b>Input<\/b>\n<pre>3\n3\n4 0 4\n7 9 8\n2\n0 3\n10 9\n4\n0 3 0 2\n6 8 1 5\n\n<\/pre>\n<b>Output:<\/b>\n<pre>9\n32\n22\n\n<\/pre>\n<b>Constraints<\/b>\n<pre>T &lt; 51\n0 &lt; N &lt; 9<\/pre>\n<p align=\"justify\">All the co-ordinates will be non negative integers with at most 15 digits.<\/p>    ","languages_supported":"NA","title":"HPARITY","category":"NA","old_version":true,"problem_code":"HPARITY"}

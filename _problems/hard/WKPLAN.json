Obviously, Chef dislikes running the restaurant by himself. In order to avoid such a terrible thing, he decided to hire exactly $M$ workers (numbered $1$ through $M$) to help him.\n\nThe workers will choose some positive integer constants $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_M$. A worker with a constant $a$ wants to be paid a fixed salary after each $a$ days. Chef is very orderly, so he wants to choose a *Chef-year* \u2014 a period of $x$ days, and a *Chef-week* \u2014 a period of $y$ days, where $x$ and $y$ depend on the workers' constants in such a way that Chef can always pay each worker's salary at the end of a Chef-week and all the workers are paid their salaries at once at the end of a Chef-year.\n\nChef also wants a Chef-year to be as short as possible and a Chef-week to be as long as possible. It can be shown that these conditions are satisfied when $x$ is the lowest common multiple of $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_M$ and $y$ is the greatest common divisor of $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_M$. For a group of $M$ workers with known $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_M$, Chef then defines the *value* of the group as $x^p f(y)$\uff0cwhere $f(x) = \\sum_{i = 0}^q f_i x^{q-i}$ is a polynomial of degree $q$.\n\nNow, Chef wants to know the sum of values of the group of $M$ workers over all possible sequences $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_M$ which meet the constraint $x \\le N$. Since the answer may be extremely large, you should compute it modulo $10^9 + 7$.\n\n**Note**: This problem has a stricter submission limit, each user may only submit this problem at most 50 times during the contest.\n\n### Input\n- The first line of the input contains four space-separated integers $N$, $M$, $p$ and $q$.\n- The second line contains $q+1$ space-separated integers $f_0, f_1, \\ldots, f_q$ \u2014 the coefficients of the polynomial $f$.\n\n### Output\nPrint a single line containing one integer \u2014 the sum of values for all possible groups of workers modulo $10^9 + 7$.\n\n### Constraints\n- $1 \\le N \\le 5 \\times 10^{12}$\n- $1 \\le M \\le 10^9$\n- $0 \\le p, q \\le 20$\n- $0 \\le f_i < 10^9 + 7$ for each valid $i$\n- $f_0 \\neq 0$\n\n### Subtasks\n**Subtask #1 (5 points):**\n- $1 \\le N, M \\le 1,000$\n- time limit 1 second\n\n**Subtask #2 (10 points):**\n- $1 \\le N, M \\le 10^7$\n- time limit 5 seconds\n\n**Subtask #3 (10 points):**\n- $M = 2, p = 0, q = 1, f_1 = 0$\n- $1 \\le N \\le 10^{11}$ \n\n**Subtask #4 (25 points):** $1 \\le N \\le 10^{11}$\n\n**Subtask #5 (50 points):** original constraints\n\n### Example Input\n```\n5 2 1 1\n1 0\n```\n\n### Example Output\n```\n99\n```\n\n### Explanation\nThere are $15$ possible sequences: $[1, 1]$, $[1, 2]$, $[1, 3]$, $[1, 4]$, $[1, 5]$, $[2, 1]$, $[2, 2]$, $[2, 4]$, $[3, 1]$, $[3, 3]$, $[4, 1]$, $[4, 2]$, $[4, 4]$, $[5, 1]$, $[5, 5]$.

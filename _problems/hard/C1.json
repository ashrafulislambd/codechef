A mismatch is any such pair of neighbouring elements of sequence w[i] and w[i+1], that w[i]&gt;w[i+1]+1.\nAs long as there is any mismatch, you solve it by swapping the mismatching numbers. Given an input sequence, calculate one of the possible output mismatch-less sequences obtained by successively solving mistmatches by swapping.\n\n\n<h3>Input<\/h3>\n<\/p><p>First - 1&lt;=t&lt;=10 - the number of tests. For each test: first - 1&lt;=n&lt;=100000.

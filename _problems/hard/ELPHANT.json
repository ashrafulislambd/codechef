The show consists of a series of<br \/>\n    acts. In each act, exactly one elephant performs a cute dance while possibly moving to a different position.<\/p>\n<p>The show producers want to produce a photo book that contains pictures of the entire show. After each act, they want<br \/>\n    to take pictures of all elephants as seen by the spectators.<\/p>\n<p>At any time during the show, multiple elephants may share the same position. In that case, they simply stand behind<br \/>\n    one another at the same position.\n<\/p>\n<p>A single camera can take a picture of a group of elephants if and only if all their positions lie on some segment of<br \/>\n    length <b>L<\/b> (including both its endpoints). As the elephants can spread out across the stage, multiple cameras<br \/>\n    may be needed in order to take simultaneous snapshots of all the elephants.<\/p>\n<p> As an example, suppose that <b>L=10<\/b> and that the elephants are at positions 10, 15, 17, and 20 on the stage. At<br \/>\n    this moment, a single camera can take their picture, as shown below. (Elephants are shown as triangles; cameras are<br \/>\n    shown as trapezoids.)<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/elephant_1.png\" alt=\"elephant_1\" \/><br \/>\n<br\/><\/br\/><\/p>\n<p>In the following act, the elephant at position 15 dances to position 32. After this act, we need at least two cameras<br \/>\n    to take the snapshot.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/elephant_2.png\" alt=\"elephant_2\" \/> <br\/><\/br\/><\/p>\n<p>In the next act, the elephant at position 10 moves to position 7. For the new arrangement of elephants, we need three<br \/>\n    cameras to photograph all of them.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/elephant_3.png\" alt=\"elephant_3\" \/><br\/><\/br\/><\/p>\n<p>In this task, you have to determine the minimum number of cameras needed to take the pictures after each<br \/>\n    of the acts.

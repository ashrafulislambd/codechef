Note that: begin[i] may be equals to end[i], but he must at least moved to another city during this travel. He can go on one road many times, but it will have a cost for each time.\n<br>\n<br>\nThe cost of this parade is the sum of these items:\n<br>\n1. The sum of costs by traveling on roads. (If a road is passed by k heroes, then it must be count k times.)\n<br>\n2. If for a hero, he ended at a city that not equals to his start city, i.e. begin[i] != end[i], then it will cost <b>C<\/b> dollars to move him back to his home.\n<br>\n3.

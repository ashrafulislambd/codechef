{"body":"\n<h3> All submissions for this problem are available. <\/h3><p><b>Problem Statement Updated. <\/b><\/p>\n<p>Johnny is the author of the famous open source software ByteDict (Bytelandian electronic dictionary).<\/p>\n<p>Being a fan of the word game Scrabble, Johnny would like to make ByteDict useful for Scrabble training. Therefore, he has decided to implement the \"Wildcard Matching\" feature.<\/p>\n<p>Wildcard matching allows ByteDict's users to search for words matching a given wildcard pattern. A wildcard pattern may include the characters '*' or '?' in addition to the characters of the alphabet. A '*' matches any sequence of characters (including the empty sequence) and a '?' matches any single character.<\/p>\n<p>To be more precise, a wildcard pattern is matched with a word if we can replace each '?' with an alphabet character and each '*' with a sequence of alphabet characters so that after replacement, the pattern becomes identical to the word.<\/p>\n<p>Now, as usual, please help Johnny implement the feature!<\/p>\n<h3>Input<\/h3>\n<p>The first line contains a number t (about 2) which is the number of test cases. Then t test cases follow. Each test case has the following form.<\/p>\n<p>The first line contains two integers N and Q (1 &lt;= N &lt;= 55000, 1 &lt;= Q &lt;= 300) which are the number of words in the dictionary and the number of wildcard queries.<\/p>\n<p>Each line in the next N lines contains a word from the dictionary. The alphabet consists of lower and uppercase characters as well as digits.<\/p>\n<p>Each line in the next Q lines contains a wildcard pattern.<\/p>\n<p>The length of each word does not exceed 25 and the length of each wildcard pattern does not exceed 5.<\/p>\n<p>Each test case is separated by a blank line.<\/p>\n<h3>Output<\/h3>\n<p>For each wildcard query print a line containing the query itself and the number of words in the dictionary that match the query.<\/p>\n<p>Print a blank line after each test case's output.<\/p>\n<h3>Example<\/h3>\n<pre><b>Input:<\/b>\n2\n1 7\nabc\nabc\ncba\na??\n??a\n*?a\n***\n**a\n\n7 4\nspoj\ncodechef\nuva\ntju\nonlinejudge\nAcmicpc\nWorldcup2010\n*a*\nsp?*\n*c*\nuvc\n\n<b>Output:<\/b>\nabc 1\ncba 0\na?? 1\n??a 0\n*?a 0\n*** 1\n**a 0\n\n*a* 1\nsp?* 1\n*c* 3\nuvc 0\n<\/pre>\n<p><\/p>    ","languages_supported":"NA","title":"L2","category":"NA","old_version":true,"problem_code":"L2"}

{"body":"\n<h3> All submissions for this problem are available. <\/h3><p>Dexter wants to make a hexagon by using six sticks for sides from a collection of sticks of lengths <b>1, 2, 3, ... N<\/b>. Dexter will only make <b>valid<\/b> hexagons whose area is strictly positive.<br \/><br \/> He considers a hexagon \"good\" if the biggest stick has  <b>length at least L<\/b> and lengths of all the other sticks <b>are not more than X<\/b>.  A \"good\" hexagon does not have sticks of the <b>same length more than K times<\/b>.   How many ways he can make a \"good\" hexagon?<br \/><br \/> For example, when N=8, L=7, X=5, K=3: { 1,2,2,5,5,7 } is a good hexagon but {1,2,2,2,2,7}, { 1,2,3,4,5,6},{1,2,3,4,6,7} are not .<br \/><br \/> Two hexagons are considered different if their side length sets are different. For example {1,2,3,4,5,6} , {1,1,1,2,2,3} and {1,1,2,2,2,3} are all different   hexagons. But {1,2,3,4,5,6} and { 2,4,6,1,3,5} are not different.<\/p>\n<h3>Input<\/h3>\n<p>Input contains four integers <b>N( 2 &lt;= N &lt;= 10^9)<\/b> , <b>L ( 2 &lt;= L &lt;= N<\/b> and <b>N-L&lt;=100)<\/b> , <b> X(  1&lt;=X&lt; L )<\/b> and<b> K ( 1 &lt;=  K &lt;= 5) <\/b>.<\/p>\n<h3>Output<\/h3>\n<p>Output the number of different ways to make a \"good\" hexagon <b>% 1000000007.<\/b><\/p>\n<h3>Sample Input<\/h3>\n<pre>10 8 6 2<\/pre>\n<h3>Sample Output<\/h3>\n<pre>374<\/pre>\n<p><\/p>    ","languages_supported":"NA","title":"CNTHEX","category":"NA","old_version":true,"problem_code":"CNTHEX"}

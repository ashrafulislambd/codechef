The nodes are numbered from 1 to <b>N<\/b>, and the root is the node numbered 1. For each node X which is not a leaf, you must choose a node Y which is a child of X and mark the edge between X and Y as heavy (red in the picture below).\n<\/p>\n<p>\nOnce this has been done, we calculate the cost of each path from the root to a leaf. For this, we decompose the path into segments, where each segment has all light edges or all heavy edges, and each segment is maximal (ie. each segment is as long as possible). So, a path will start with a heavy segment or a light segment, but the segment types will alternate between heavy and light.<\/p>\n\n<p>The length of a segment is the number of edges in it. The cost of a light segment with length L is L, and the cost of a heavy segment with length L is (ceiling[log<sub>2<\/sub>L]+1). The cost of a path from the root to a leaf will be the sum of costs of all the segments.<\/p> \n\n<p>The decomposition into segments is done independently for each path.<\/p>\n\n<p> For example:<\/p>\n\n<p><\/p>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/codechef_shared.s3.amazonaws.com\/download\/upload\/APRIL17\/hld.png\" height=\"300\"\/>\n<p><\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The path 1 \u2192 9 contains one heavy segment (1 \u2192 2) with length 1 and one light segment (2 \u2192 9) with length 2, so the cost is (ceiling[log<sub>2<\/sub>1]+1) + 2 = (0 + 1) + 2 = 3.<\/li>\n<p><\/p>\n<li>The path 1 \u2192 17 contains one light segment (1 \u2192 3) with length 1 and one segment (3 \u2192 17) with length 5, so the cost is 1 + (ceiling[log<sub>2<\/sub>5]+1) = 1 + (3 + 1) = 5.<\/li>\n<p><\/p>\n<li>The path 1 \u2192 15 has cost 1 + (ceiling[log<sub>2<\/sub>2]+1) + 1 = 1 + (1 + 1) + 1 = 4.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>Consider all the paths from the root to leaves. The maximum cost among all these paths, is defined to be the 'cost' of the tree.\nDifferent ways of choosing heavy edges can lead to different \u2018costs' of the tree.<\/p>\n\n<p>\nPlease find the minimum \u2018cost' of the tree achievable. \n<\/p>\n\n\n<h3>Input<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The first line contains one integer, <b>T<\/b>, the number of test cases.

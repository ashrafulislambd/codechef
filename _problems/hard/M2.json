{"body":"\n<h3> All submissions for this problem are available. <\/h3><p>It's time for the annual exciting Motorbike Race in Byteland.<\/p>\n<p>There are N motorcyclists taking part in the competition. Johnny is watching the race. At the present moment (time 0), Johnny has taken note of the current velocity and position of each motorcyclist.<\/p>\n<p>Johnny wants to know at a given point of time, which motorcyclist is in a specific place in the rank list. Please help him!<\/p>\n<p>If at any given time two motorcyclists are in same position, the motorcyclist with the smaller index will be placed before the one with the larger index.<\/p>\n<p>To make the problem simple, Johnny assumes that each motorcyclist is moving at a constant velocity.<\/p>\n\n<h3>Input<\/h3>\n<p>The first line contains a number t (about 10) which is the number of test cases. Then t test cases follow. Each test case has the following form.<\/p>\n<p>The first line of the test case contains a number N (1 &lt;= N &lt;= 20000), the number of motorcyclists.<\/p>\n<p>The i-th line in the next N lines contains two numbers, v and x, which are the velocity and the current position of the i-th motorcyclist (1 &lt;= v, x &lt;= 100,000).<\/p>\n<p>The next line contains a number Q (1 &lt;= Q &lt;= 20000), the number of time queries.<\/p>\n<p>Each line in the next Q lines contains two numbers, t (1 &lt;= t &lt;= 1,000,000,000) and k (1 &lt;= k &lt;= n), representing the query: \"at time t, which motorcyclist is positioned k-th in the rank list?\"<\/p>\n<h3>Output<\/h3>\n<p>For each test case, print Q lines, with each line containing the index of the motorcyclist for the corresponding query.<\/p>\n<p>Remember to print a new line after each test case.<\/p>\n\n<h3>Example<\/h3>\n\n<pre>\n<b>Input:<\/b>\n1\n4\n2 100\n3 50\n4 60\n5 1\n4\n1 1\n50 2\n60 4\n100 1\n\n<b>Output:<\/b>\n1\n4\n1\n4\n<\/pre>    ","languages_supported":"NA","title":"M2","category":"NA","old_version":true,"problem_code":"M2"}

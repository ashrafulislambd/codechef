When Chef was cooking donuts, thunder suddenly came across the gray-blue sky. That's how Lemon came to Earth, and that's also why she loves DONUTS! Since Lemon is a clever person, she often thinks about some problem before having donuts. This time, she thought about the following problem: There are $N$ donuts. Each donut is a torus described by parameters $x$, $y$, $z$, $R$, $r$, where the center of the torus has Cartesian coordinates $(x, y, z)$, $R$ is the distance from the center of the torus to the center of its tube and $r$ is the radius of the tube. The rotational axis of each torus is parallel with the $z$-axis. The tori may touch or intersect each other. What is the total volume they take up, i.e. the volume of the union of all $N$ tori? ### Input - The first line of the input contains a single integer $N$. - Each of the following $N$ lines contains five space-separated real numbers $x$, $y$, $z$, $R$ and $r$ describing one torus. ### Output - Print a single line containing one real number â€” the total volume of the $N$ tori. Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute error does not exceed $10^{-2}$. ### Constraints - $1\\leq N \\le 20$ - $-900 \\leq x, y, z \\leq 600$ - $ 0.1 \\leq r \\leq R \\leq 50$ ### Example Input ``` 1 0 0 0 5 2 ``` ### Example Output ``` 394.78417590 ```

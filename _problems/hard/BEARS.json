This problem is right about this -- unfortunately, not about bears and bees (but if you want, you may think of vertices as of bears and of edges as of bees (or even vice versa)).\n\n<\/p><p>Suppose you're given an undirected graph <b>G<sub>0<\/sub><\/b> with <b>N<\/b> vertices and <b>M<\/b> edges. Let's perform a <i>simple transformation<\/i> on graph <b>G<sub>0<\/sub><\/b> to obtain graph <b>G<sub>1<\/sub><\/b> with <b>M<\/b> vertices so that each vertex of <b>G<sub>1<\/sub><\/b> corresponds to a unique edge of <b>G<sub>0<\/sub><\/b> and a pair of vertices in <b>G<sub>1<\/sub><\/b> is connected by a single edge if and only if the corresponding edges of <b>G<sub>0<\/sub><\/b> share a common vertex. Similarly, let's perform a simple transformation on graph <b>G<sub>1<\/sub><\/b> to obtain graph <b>G<sub>2<\/sub><\/b>, and let's perform a simple transformation on graph <b>G<sub>2<\/sub><\/b> to obtain graph <b>G<sub>3<\/sub><\/b>.\n\n<\/p><p>All you have to do is to output the number of vertices and edges in <b>G<sub>3<\/sub><\/b>.\n\n<h3>Input<\/h3>\n<\/p><p>The first line of the input file contains one integer <b>T<\/b> -- the number of test cases (no more than 10). Each test case is described by a line containing two integers <b>N<\/b> and <b>M<\/b> (1 \u2264 <b>N<\/b>, <b>M<\/b> \u2264 1000) followed by <b>M<\/b> lines, each containing two integers between 1 and <b>N<\/b>, inclusive, separated by a single space and describing an edge of graph <b>G<sub>0<\/sub><\/b>. It's guaranteed that each edge connects two distinct vertices and each pair of vertices is directly connected by at most one edge.\n\n<h3>Output<\/h3>\n<\/p><p>For each test case output just one line containing two integers -- the number of vertices and edges in <b>G<sub>3<\/sub><\/b>.\n\n<h3>Example<\/h3>\n\n<pre>\n<b>Input:<\/b>\n2\n3 3\n1 2\n1 3\n2 3\n4 4\n1 2\n1 3\n2 3\n3 4\n\n<b>Output:<\/b>\n3 3\n8 18\n\n<b>Explanation:<\/b>\n<\/pre>\n<\/p><p>In the first test case the given graph is a \"triangle\". It's easy to see that a simple transformation on a triangle results in the same triangle (as it contains three pairwise connected vertices and three pairwise \"connected\" edges).<\/p>    ","languages_supported":"NA","title":"BEARS","category":"NA","old_version":true,"problem_code":"BEARS"}

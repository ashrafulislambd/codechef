First will be given 1   &lt;= t &lt;= 20, then number of testcases. Then t testcases follow. Each testcase is of following form. First, 1   &lt;= n &lt;= 50000, the number of points. The following n lines define the points; the i-th line contains two integers: -10000   &lt;= x<sub>i<\/sub>,y<sub>i<\/sub> &lt;= 10000<\/p>\n<p>.<\/p>\n<h3>Output<\/h3>\n<p>Output exactly one value: the radius of largest possible disc satisfying the given property.

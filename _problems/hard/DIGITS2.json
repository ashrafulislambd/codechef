S will have between 1 and 4 characters, and the first character will not be 0.\n<\/p>\n\n<h3>Output<\/h3>\n<p>For each test case, output a single integer on a line, giving the minimum\nvalue of I (printed in decimal).\nIt is guaranteed that I will fit in a 64-bit integer.<\/p>\n\n<h3>Sample Input<\/h3>\n<pre>4\n9\n11\n7Q2\nPIES\n<\/pre>\n\n<h3>Sample Output<\/h3>\n<pre>9\n8\n15227\n7845414\n<\/pre>    ","languages_supported":"NA","title":"DIGITS2","category":"NA","old_version":true,"problem_code":"DIGITS2"}

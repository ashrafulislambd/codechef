Johnny picks an arbitrary positive integer <i>n<\/i> (1&lt;=<i>n<\/i>&lt;=10<sup>9<\/sup>) and gives Alice exactly <i>k<\/i> hints about the value of <i>n<\/i>. It is Alice's task to guess <i>n<\/i>, based on the received hints. <\/p>\n<p>\nAlice often has a serious problem guessing the value of <i>n<\/i>, and she's beginning to suspect that Johnny occasionally cheats, that is, gives her incorrect hints.<br \/>\nAfter the last game, they had the following little conversation:<\/p>\n<div align=\"justify\">\n<ul>\n<li>[Alice] Johnny, you keep cheating!\n<\/li><li>[Johnny] Indeed? You cannot prove it.\n<\/li><li>[Alice] Oh yes I can. In fact, I can tell you with the utmost certainty that in the last game you lied to me at least *** times.\n<\/li><\/ul>\n<\/div>\n<p>\nSo, how many times at least did Johnny lie to Alice? Try to determine this, knowing only the hints Johnny gave to Alice.<\/p>\n<h3>Input<\/h3>\n<p>The first line of input contains <i>t<\/i>, the number of test cases (about 20). Exactly <i>t<\/i> test cases follow. <\/p>\n<p>Each test case starts with a line containing a single integer <i>k<\/i>, denoting the number of hints given by Johnny (1&lt;=<i>k<\/i>&lt;=100000). Each of the next <i>k<\/i> lines contains exactly one hint. The <i>i<\/i>-th hint is of the form:<\/p>\n<p>\n <tt>operator<\/tt> <i>l<sub>i<\/sub><\/i> <tt>logical_value<\/tt>\n<\/p>\n<p>where <tt>operator<\/tt> denotes one of the symbols <tt>&lt; <\/tt>, <tt>> <\/tt>, or <tt>=<\/tt>; <i>l<sub>i<\/sub><\/i> is an integer (1&lt;=<i>l<sub>i<\/sub><\/i>&lt;=10<sup>9<\/sup>), while <tt>logical_value<\/tt> is one of the words: <tt>Yes<\/tt> or <tt>No<\/tt>. The hint is considered correct if <tt>logical_value<\/tt> is the correct reply to the question: \"Does the relation: <i>n<\/i> <tt>operator<\/tt> <i>l<sub>i<\/sub><\/i> hold?\", and is considered to be false (a lie) otherwise.<\/p>\n<h3>Output<\/h3>\n<p>For each test case output a line containing a single integer, equal to the minimal possible number of Johnny's lies during the game.<\/p>\n<h3>Example<\/h3>\n<pre>\n<b>Input:<\/b>\n3\n2\n&lt; 100 No\n> 100 No\n3\n&lt; 2 Yes\n> 4 Yes\n= 3 No\n6\n&lt; 2 Yes\n> 1 Yes\n= 1 Yes\n= 1 Yes\n> 1 Yes\n= 1 Yes\n\n<b>Output:<\/b>\n0\n1\n2\n<\/pre><p><b>Explanation:<\/b> for the respective test cases, the number picked by Johnny could have been e.g. <i>n<\/i>=100, <i>n<\/i>=5, and <i>n<\/i>=1.<\/p>\n    ","languages_supported":"NA","title":"MARCHA3","category":"NA","old_version":true,"problem_code":"MARCHA3"}

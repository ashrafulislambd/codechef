{"body":"\n<h3> All submissions for this problem are available. <\/h3><p>\nThere are N cities numbered from 0..N-1. A salesman is located at city 0. He wishes to visit all cities exactly once and return back to city 0. There are K toll booths. Each toll booth has a certain range of functioning. The parameters for toll k are given as x_k and y_k. If the salesman travels from city i to j, he has to pay 1 dollar toll fee to each toll p having x_p &gt;= i and y_p &lt;= j. Calculate the cheapest way for the salesman to complete his tour.\n\n<h3>\nInput :\n<\/h3>\nThe first line contains T the number of test cases. T test cases follow. The first line of each test case contains two space seperated integers N and K. Each of the next K lines contains 2 integers, the ith line containing x_i and y_i (0 &lt;= x_i,y_i &lt; N). A blank line seperates two test cases.\n\n<h3>\nOutput :\n<\/h3>\nOutput T lines, one for each test case, containing the required answer.\n\n<h3>\nSample Input :<\/h3>\n<pre>\n2\n3 2\n2 0\n0 2\n\n3 4\n1 0\n2 1\n0 1\n1 2\n\n<\/pre>\n\n<h3>\nSample Output :<\/h3>\n<pre>\n3\n6\n\n<\/pre>\n\n<h3>\nConstraints :<\/h3>\n<pre>\n1 &lt;= T &lt;= 50\n2 &lt;= n &lt;= 1000\n1 &lt;= K &lt;= 10000\n<\/pre><\/p>    ","languages_supported":"NA","title":"TSPAGAIN","category":"NA","old_version":true,"problem_code":"TSPAGAIN"}

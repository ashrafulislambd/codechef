Nazik gave Batman a tree with $N$ vertices (numbered $1$ through $N$). There are some robbers in the tree; of course, Batman wants to catch the robbers. Initially, Batman is in a vertex $s$ and his power is equal to $p$. During each of the next $M$ seconds, the following process happens: - A robber with power $r$ runs from a vertex $x$ straight to vertex $y$. - Batman either catches the robber or stays in his current vertex (and never catches this robber). - Batman can only catch the robber if Batman's power is strictly greater than the robber's power. - Let's denote Batman's current vertex by $s$ ($s=s\_i$ initially). To catch the robber, Batman must choose a vertex $g$ such that each vertex on the simple path between $x$ and $y$ (inclusive) lies also on the simple path between $s$ and $g$ (inclusive). If it is impossible to choose a vertex $g$ so that this condition is satisfied, Batman cannot catch this robber. - If Batman catches the robber, $g$ becomes his current vertex. - After Batman catches this robber, his power increases by $t$. Your task is to calculate the maximum power Batman can have after $M$ seconds if he chooses the robbers to catch optimally. ### Input - The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows. - The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers $N$, $s\_i$ and $p$. - Each of the next $N-1$ lines contains two space-separated integers $u$ and $v$ denoting an edge in the tree between vertices $u$ and $v$. - The next line contains a single integer $M$. - Each of the following $M$ lines contains four integers $x$, $y$, $r$ and $t$ describing a robber. ### Output For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€” the maximum possible value of Batman's power after $M$ seconds. ### Constraints - $1 \\le T \\le 1,000$ - $1 \\le N, M \\le 4\\cdot10^5$ - $1 \\le s\_i, u, v \\le N$ - the graph described on the input is a tree - $1 \\le x, y \\le N$ - $x \\neq y$ - $1 \\le p, r \\le 10^9$ - $|t| \\le 10^9$ - the sum of $N$ for all test cases does not exceed $4\\cdot10^5$ - the sum of $M$ for all test cases does not exceed $4\\cdot10^5$ ### Example Input ``` 1 6 1 4 1 2 2 3 2 4 4 5 1 6 5 6 4 3 8 1 2 3 2 4 6 5 -1 6 5 4 6 5 4 5 -3 ``` ### Example Output ``` 12 ``` ### Explanation \*\*Example case 1:\*\* - In the 2-nd second, Batman will go from vertex $s=1$ to vertex $g=5$. - In the 4-th second, Batman will go from vertex $s=5$ to vertex $g=6$. - Batman should ignore robbers moving in the 1-st, 3-rd and 5-th second.

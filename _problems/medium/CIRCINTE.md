All submissions for this problem are available.The integers $0$ to $M - 1$ have been arranged in a circular fashion. That is, $0, 1, 2, \\ldots, M - 1$, are in that order and also, $0$ and $M - 1$ are next to each other. The distance between any two adjacent numbers on this circle is 1. You are given $N$ intervals on this, such that no two intervals touch or intersect with each other. The i-th interval will be of the form \[$L\_i, R\_i$\]. This means that the i-th interval contains all the integers between $L\_i$ and $R\_i$, both end points inclusive. You are supposed to mark exactly one number inside each interval, in such a way that the minimum distance between any two marked numbers is maximized. More formally, we have $0 \\leq L\_1 \\leq R\_1

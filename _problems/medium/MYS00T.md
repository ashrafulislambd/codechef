Each vertex has a value; let's denote the value of vertex $i$ by $a\_i$. Vertex $v$ is a \*bad adjacent\* of vertex $u$ if there is an edge between vertices $u$ and $v$ and $a\_v$ is strictly greater than $a\_u$. Your task is to find a vertex without any bad adjacent or determine that there is no such vertex. You do not know the values $a\_1, a\_2, \\ldots, a\_N$, but you may ask up to $20$ questions. In each question, you should choose a vertex $x$; the grader responds with the number of some bad adjacent vertex of vertex $x$ or with $-1$ if $x$ does not have any bad adjacent. ### Interaction - First, you should read a line containing a single integer â€” the number of test cases $T$. The description of interaction for $T$ test cases follows. - For each test case, first, you should read a line containing a single integer $N$. - Then, you should read $N-1$ lines. Each of these lines contains two space-separated integers $u$ and $v$ denoting that vertices $u$ and $v$ are connected by an edge. - Then, you may ask questions. - To ask a question, you should print a line containing two space-separated integers $1$ and $x$ ($1 \\le x \\le N$). - Then, you should read a line containing a single integer $y$. - If the question was invalid or if you asked too many questions, $y = -2$. If $x$ has no bad adjacent, $y = -1$. Otherwise, $y$ is the number of a bad adjacent of $x$. - When you have determined the answer, you should print a line containing two space-separated integers $2$ and $x$. If there is no vertex without a bad adjacent, $x$ should be $-1$; otherwise, $x$ should be the number of a vertex without a bad adjacent. - Finally, you should read a line containing a single integer: $1$ if your answer is correct or $-2$ if it is incorrect. If your answer is correct, you should continue solving the remaining test cases. Note that when you receive $-2$ (either as the response to a question or to your answer), you should immediately terminate your program to receive a Wrong Answer verdict; otherwise, you may receive any verdict. Don't forget to flush the output after printing each line! ### Constraints - $1 \\le T \\le 100$ - $2 \\le N \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$ - $1 \\le a\_i \\le 2 \\cdot 10^9$ for each valid $i$ - $1 \\le u, v \\le N$ - the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $6 \\cdot 10^5$ ### Example ``` Grader You 2 3 1 2 1 3 1 1 2 1 2 -1 2 2 1 4 1 2 2 3 2 4 1 1 2 1 2 -1 2 2 1 ``` ### Explanation \*\*Example case 1:\*\* The values of vertices in the tree are $a\_1 = 3$, $a\_2 = 10$, $a\_3 = 20$. Note that the answer to the first query could have been $3$ instead of $2$ as well. \*\*Example case 2:\*\* The values of vertices in the tree are $a\_1 = 4$, $a\_2 = 9$, $a\_3 = 3$ and $a\_4 = 3$.

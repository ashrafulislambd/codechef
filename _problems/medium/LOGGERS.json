{"body":"\n<h3> All submissions for this problem are available. <\/h3><p>Logging can be a very mundane job, but Alice and Bob have devised a game to help them\npass the time.  They take turns choosing a log, and cutting it into 2 smaller logs.\nThe sum of the lengths of the 2 logs equals the length of the original log.  The only\nrestriction is that neither of the resulting logs may be shorter than 1 meter in length (but\nexactly 1 meter is fine).  In other words, non-integer lengths are allowed.  Alice makes the first cut, and the first logger who cannot\nmake a legal cut loses.<\/p>\n\n<h3>Input<\/h3>\n<p>Input begins with an integer T, the number of test cases (less than 450).  T test cases\nfollow, each on its own line.  Each test case begins with an integer N, the number of\nlogs at the start of the game.  N integers follow, giving the initial lengths of the logs.\nThere are at most 7 logs, and the total length of the logs will not exceed 250 meters.\nNote that the initial lengths of the logs are integers, but logs may be cut to non-integer lengths.<\/p>\n\n<h3>Output<\/h3>\n<p>For each test case, output a single line containing the name of the winner of the game,\nassuming both loggers choose their cuts optimally.<\/p>\n\n<h3>Sample Input<\/h3>\n<pre>3\n1 2\n2 3 4\n3 7 8 9\n<\/pre>\n\n<h3>Sample Output<\/h3>\n<pre>Alice\nAlice\nBob\n<\/pre>    ","languages_supported":"NA","title":"LOGGERS","category":"NA","old_version":true,"problem_code":"LOGGERS"}

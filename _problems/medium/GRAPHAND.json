The nodes are numbered from 1 to $n$. Each edge $e$ of the graph has two integers associated with it, cost($c_e$) and value($v_e$). You are given three integers $s$, $t$, and $K$. \n\nThe cost of a walk is the sum of costs of all the edges in the walk. Find the minimum cost of a walk from $s$ to $t$ ($s \\neq t$ ), such that the bitwise AND of values for all edges in the walk is atleast $K$. If no such walk exists, print $-1$.\n\nNote that the walk doesn't need to be a simple path. Any vertex or edge can come more than once in the walk you choose. If an edge $e$ comes $p$ times, we add its cost $p$ times to the cost of the walk.\n\nFormally, a walk from $s$ to $t$ is a sequence of vertices and edges $u_1, e_1, u_2, e_2, \\cdots, u_{l-1}, e_{l-1}, u_{l} $, where $e_i$ is the edge between vertices $u_{i}$ and $u_{i+1}$, $u_1 = s$ and $u_l = t$.\n\nWe need to minimize $\\displaystyle \\sum_{i=1}^{l-1} c_{e_i} $, while satisfying $ v_{e_1} \\& v_{e_2} \\& \\cdots \\& v_{e_{l-1}} \\geq K$, where $\\&$ denotes the bitwise AND operator.\n\n###Input:\n\n- First line will contain $n$ and $m$\n- Each of the next $m$ lines will contain the description of an edge in the graph. It will consist of 4 integers $a, b, c, v$ denoting the endpoints, cost and val of the edge respectively.\n- The last line contains $s, t, K$, as described in the statement.\n\n###Output:\nPrint the minimum cost of a walk from $s$ to $t$, such that the bitwise AND of values for all edges in the walk is atleast $K$. Print $-1$ if no such walk exists.\n\n###Constraints \n- $1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$\n- $1 \\leq c_i, v_i \\leq 10^9$\n- $1 \\le s, t \\leq n$\n- $s \\neq t$\n- $ 1 \\le K \\le 10^9$\n- The graph contains no self loops and multiedges.\n\n###Sample Input:\n\n```\n3 3\n1 2 2 3\n2 3 1 7\n1 3 2 2\n1 3 3\n```\n\n###Sample Output:\n```\n3\n```\n\t\n###Explanation:\n\nSuppose we choose the edge between 1 and 3 and say that's our walk. Its cost is 2. But this is not a valid walk, because the AND of the edge values is 2. We need it to be $\\ge$ 3.\n\nSo, instead suppose we choose the walk from $1$ to $3$ passing through $2$. The bitwise AND is 3 & 7 = 3, and cost is 1 + 2 = 3. This is a valid walk, and you can check that you cannot reduce the cost any further. Hence 3 is the answer.","languages_supported":"C, CPP14, JAVA, PYTH, PYTH 3.6, PYPY, CS2, PAS fpc, PAS gpc, RUBY, PHP, GO, NODEJS, HASK, rust, SCALA, swift, D, PERL, FORT, WSPC, ADA, CAML, ICK, BF, ASM, CLPS, PRLG, ICON, SCM qobi, PIKE, ST, NICE, LUA, BASH, NEM, LISP sbcl, LISP clisp, SCM guile, JS, ERL, TCL, kotlin, PERL6, TEXT, SCM chicken, PYP3, CLOJ, COB, FS","max_timelimit":"1","source_sizelimit":"50000","problem_author":"jtnydv25","problem_author_html_handle":"<span \n            class='rating' \n            style='display: inline-block; \n                    font-size: 10px; \n                    background: #FF7F00;\n                    padding: 0 3px; \n                    line-height: 1.3; \n                    color: white;\n                    margin-right: 2px;'>6&#9733;<\/span><span>jtnydv25<\/span>","problem_tester":null,"problem_tester_html_handle":"","date_added":"15-12-2018","tags":"<a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/jtnydv25'>jtnydv25<\/a>","time":{"view_start_date":1544985000,"submit_start_date":1544985000,"visible_start_date":1544985000,"end_date":1735669800,"current":1559472974},"user":{"username":"","access":"default"},"todo":false,"problem_status":"unattempted","is_direct_submittable":false}

Gritukan likes to take cyclic trips around the world. There are $N$ countries numbered $1$ through $N$ in the world. Before starting his travels, Gritukan chooses a permutation $P$ of all $N$ countries. Then, he visits all countries (some countries may be visited multiple times) using the following algorithm: - for each $v$ from $1$ to $N$ inclusive: - travel to country $v$ - travel from country $v$ to country $P\_v$, then from country $P\_v$ to country $P\_{P\_v}$, and so on until he reaches country $v$ again; let's call this sequence of visited countries a \*cyclic route\* (Each country appears at most once in a cyclic route. It is also possible for a route to contain only one country if $v=P\_v$, in which case Gritukan's travel along this route consists of staying in country $v$.) Unfortunately, Gritukan does not remember the routes he took. He only remembers a sequence $A\_{1..N}$ with the following meaning: for each country $v$, the number of cyclic routes which contained this country is $A\_v$. Given the sequence $A$, Gritukan asks you to calculate the number of permutations $P$ consistent with this sequence, modulo $998244353$ (it's prime). ### Input - The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows. - The first line of each test case contains a single integer $N$. - The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $A\_1, A\_2, \\dots, A\_N$. ### Output For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€” the number of possible permutations modulo $998244353$ (it's prime). ### Constraints - $1 \\le T \\le 100$ - $1 \\le N \\le 10^6$ - $1 \\le A\_i \\le N$ for each valid $i$ - the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^6$ ### Subtasks \*\*Subtask #1 (40 points):\*\* $1 \\le N \\le 5000$ \*\*Subtask #2 (60 points):\*\* original constraints ### Example Input ``` 2 6 1 1 1 1 1 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 ``` ### Example Output ``` 1 120 ```

The problem description is given below.<\/p>\n<p>\"There is a rectangular room of length l and width w (l and w are integers). The length and width of the room\u00a0 fulfill the relation l=Aw+B, where A and B are given integer constants. The room is divided into square cells of unit dimensions. You have observed that, after adding an integer C to the number of cells in the room, the number of cells becomes divisible by the prime number P. Find all the possible values of the width of the room.\"<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<h3>Input<\/h3>\n<p>The first line contains t, the number of test cases (about 10000). Then t test cases follow. Each test case is given in one line containing 4 integers A, B, C and P (2 \u2264 P &lt; 10<sup>6<\/sup>, 0 &lt; A &lt; P, 0 \u2264 B,C &lt; P).<\/p>\n<p>P is always a prime number.<\/p>\n<h3>Output<\/h3>\n<p>For each test case, write the result in one line. The first number K is the number of solutions. Then K numbers X<sub>1<\/sub>, X<sub>2<\/sub>, ...,X<sub>K<\/sub> follow (0 \u2264 X<sub>i<\/sub> &lt; P), which are the solutions to the corresponding problems.<\/p>\n<h3>Example<\/h3>\n<pre><b>Input:<\/b>\n2\n1 1 0 2\n1 2 2 3\n\n<b>Output:<\/b>\n2 0 1\n0\n<\/pre>\n<p><\/p>    ","languages_supported":"NA","title":"E4","category":"NA","old_version":true,"problem_code":"E4"}

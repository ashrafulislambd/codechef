The number of white walkers in the army.\n- Next $N$ lines contains 2 integers - $(x_i,y_i)$ each denoting the x and y coordinate of white walkers.\n- Next line contains an integer $Q$ denoting the number of queries.\n- Next $Q$ lines contains 3 integers each. $L$, $R$ and $K$.\n\n###Output :\n- For each query print the number of white walkers Jon can target to make the army powerless.\n\n###Constraints :\n- $1 \\leq N \\leq 10^5$\n- $ 1 \\leq Q \\leq 2*10^5$\n- $1 \\leq L \\leq R \\leq N$\n- $1 \\leq x_i,y_i ,K \\leq 10^9$\n\n###Sample Input:\n    4\n    1 15\n    2 2\n    3 2\n    2 5\n    2\n    2 4 5\n    1 3 2\n\n###Sample Output:\n    3\n    0\n\n\t\n###EXPLANATION:\n**For query 1**\n- Active white walkers are at  (2,2), (3,2) and (2,5), as these have horizontal distance from Jon $\\leq K$.\n- Power of the active army is XOR sum of NOD of vertical distance from Jon = NOD(2) xor NOD(2) xor NOD(5), where NOD means Number of divisors. Power = 2 ^ 2 ^ 2 = 2\n- Therefore Jon can kill any one of the 3 white walkers. So the power of remaining army will be 2 ^ 2 = 0.    \n\n**For query 2**\n- Active white walkers are at  (1,15), and (2,2) as these have horizontal distance from Jon $\\leq K$.\n- Power of the active army is XOR sum of NOD of vertical distance from Jon = NOD(15) xor NOD(2) , where NOD means Number of divisors. Power = 4^2 = 6\n- There is no choice here to kill exactly 1 white walker here to render the power = 0  Hence, the answer is 0.\n","languages_supported":"C, CPP14, JAVA, PYTH, PYTH 3.6, PYPY, CS2, PAS fpc, PAS gpc, RUBY, PHP, GO, NODEJS, HASK, rust, SCALA, swift, D, PERL, FORT, WSPC, ADA, CAML, ICK, BF, ASM, CLPS, PRLG, ICON, SCM qobi, PIKE, ST, NICE, LUA, BASH, NEM, LISP sbcl, LISP clisp, SCM guile, JS, ERL, TCL, kotlin, PERL6, TEXT, SCM chicken, PYP3, CLOJ, R, COB, FS","max_timelimit":"2","source_sizelimit":"50000","problem_author":"aashu_k","problem_author_html_handle":"<span \n            class='rating' \n            style='display: inline-block; \n                    font-size: 10px; \n                    background: #684273;\n                    padding: 0 3px; \n                    line-height: 1.3; \n                    color: white;\n                    margin-right: 2px;'>4&#9733;<\/span><span>aashu_k<\/span>","problem_tester":null,"problem_tester_html_handle":"","date_added":"31-03-2019","tags":"<a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/aashu_k'>aashu_k<\/a>","time":{"view_start_date":1554669000,"submit_start_date":1554669000,"visible_start_date":1554669000,"end_date":1735669800,"current":1559472986},"user":{"username":"","access":"default"},"todo":false,"problem_status":"unattempted","is_direct_submittable":false}

They take turns alternatively, with Alice having the first turn. In a player's turn the player can pick any number (say $x$) which is greater than 1 from the array. Then the player transforms the number $x$ into $(x * i) \/ p$, where $p$ is any prime number which divides $x$ and $i$ is an integer in range $[1, p)$, that is $1 \\leq i < p$. Then the player places the transformed number back in array in place of $x$. The player who can not make a move loses.\n\n###Input:\n- The first line contains $T$, which is the number of test cases. \n- The first line of each test case denotes the size of the array which is $N$. \n- The second line of each test case contains $N$ space separated integers. which represent the original array.\n\n###Output:\nPrint one line per test case i.e. the winner of the game in that test case. It should either be \"Alice\" or \"Bob\".\n\n###Constraints \n- $1 \\leq T \\leq 100000$\n- $1 \\leq N \\leq 100000$\n- $1 \\leq$ array elements $\\leq 500000$\n- Sum of $N$ over all testcases per file won't exceed $2 * 10^5$\n\n###Sample Input:\n```\n2\n2\n2 2\n1\n2\n```\n\n###Sample Output:\n```\nBob\nAlice\n```\n\n###Explanation:\n**Testcase 1**: The array is originally {2, 2}. Alice has no choise but to pick up one of the 2. And she has no choice in $p$ either. $p = 2$ is the only choice, as no other prime number divides 2. $i=1$ is the only choice. So Alice transforms one of the 2 into (2*1)\/2 = 1. So now the array becomes {1, 2} or {2, 1}. Now, Bob has no choice but to pick up the remaining 2. And as with Alice, he will be forced to transform it into 1. The array then becomes {1, 1} and now Alice cannot make any move, and so Bob wins.\n\n**Testcase 2**: Original array is {2}, and as in the previous testcase, Alice will convert it into {1} and now Bob has no move, and so Alice wins.","languages_supported":"C, CPP14, JAVA, PYTH, PYTH 3.6, PYPY, kotlin","max_timelimit":"2.5","source_sizelimit":"50000","problem_author":"akash4983","problem_author_html_handle":"<span \n            class='rating' \n            style='display: inline-block; \n                    font-size: 10px; \n                    background: #FF7F00;\n                    padding: 0 3px; \n                    line-height: 1.3; \n                    color: white;\n                    margin-right: 2px;'>6&#9733;<\/span><span>akash4983<\/span>","problem_tester":null,"problem_tester_html_handle":"","date_added":"15-12-2018","tags":"<a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/akash4983'>akash4983<\/a>","time":{"view_start_date":1545157800,"submit_start_date":1545157800,"visible_start_date":1545157800,"end_date":1735669800,"current":1559472973},"user":{"username":"","access":"default"},"todo":false,"problem_status":"unattempted","is_direct_submittable":false}

These strings consist of only lower case characters a..z and have the same length L. \n\n<\/p><p>A string H is said to be K-important if there are at least K strings in the given set of N strings appearing at K different positions in H. These K strings need not to be distinct.\n\n<\/p><p>Your task is to find the shortest K-important string. If there are more than one possible solution, your program can output any of them.\n\n<h3>Input<\/h3>\n<\/p><p>The first line contains a number t (about 10) which is the number of test cases.\n\n<\/p><p>Each test case has the following form.\n\n<\/p><p>The first line contains three integers N, L and K. The next N lines contain the strings in the given set.\n\n<\/p><p>Each test case's input is separated by a blank line.\n\n<h3>Constraints<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>1 &#8804; N &#8804; 150<\/li>\n<li>1 &#8804; L &#8804; 300<\/li>\n<li>1 &#8804; K &#8804; 500<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<h3>Output<\/h3>\n<\/p><p>For each test case, output the following information. <\/p><p>The first line contains the length of the shortest K-important strings. \n<\/p><p>The second line contains H, one of the K-important strings. \n<\/p><p>Each line in the next K lines contains the index of one string in the given set that appears in H and the corresponding position (0-based) in H.\n\n<\/p><p>Print a blank line after each test case's output.\n\n<h3>Example<\/h3>\n\n<pre>\n<b>Input<\/b>\n3\n\n3 3 1\nabc\ncde\nbcf\n\n3 3 2\nabc\ncde\nbcf\n\n3 3 3\nabc\ncde\nbcf\n\n<b>Output<\/b>\n3\nabc\n0 0\n\n4\nabcf\n0 0\n2 1\n\n7\nabcfabc\n0 0\n2 1\n0 4\n<\/pre><\/p>    ","languages_supported":"NA","title":"N3","category":"NA","old_version":true,"problem_code":"N3"}

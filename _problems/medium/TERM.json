But as you know, he is not very good with programming. So when he fails to solve a problem he usually asks John to write a program that will solve it.\n<br \/>\nRecently the chef became interested in finding the expansion of (x<sub>1<\/sub>+x<sub>2<\/sub>+....+x<sub>k<\/sub>)<sup>n<\/sup>. Specifically he is more interested in number of terms in it. Being unable to solve the problem he asked John for help. The conversation between John and chef goes as\n<br \/>\nChef: Can you write a program that will calculate f(n,k)= number of terms in (x<sub>1<\/sub>+x<sub>2<\/sub>+....+x<sub>k<\/sub>)<sup>n<\/sup> ?\n<br \/>John: That is a very easy problem.\n<br \/>Chef: Oh, really? Then calculate the sum over (i=0 to n) (f(i,k))\n<br \/>John: That is also an easy problem.\n<br \/>Chef: Then go finish it. And did I mention that I am calculating modulo a prime number p.\n<br \/>John: What?\n<br \/>Chef: Say k=2, n=4, p=3. Then (x<sub>1<\/sub>+x<sub>2<\/sub>)<sup>4<\/sup> %3 = (x<sub>1<\/sub><sup>4<\/sup>+4 x<sub>1<\/sub><sup>3<\/sup> x<sub>2<\/sub>+6 x<sub>1<\/sub><sup>2<\/sup> x<sub>2<\/sub><sup>2<\/sup>+ 4 x<sub>1<\/sub> x<sub>2<\/sub><sup>3<\/sup> + x<sub>2<\/sub><sup>4<\/sup>) %3 = (x<sub>1<\/sub><sup>4<\/sup>+ x<sub>1<\/sub><sup>3<\/sup> x<sub>2<\/sub> + x<sub>1<\/sub> x<sub>2<\/sub><sup>3<\/sup> + x<sub>2<\/sub><sup>4<\/sup>) %3. So if p=3 then f(4,2)=4.\n<br \/>John: OK, I am doing it.\n<br \/>\nAs John started to solve the problem he realized it is not that easy. Now he asked you, his best friend, for help.\n<br \/>\nAs the answer can be quite large print the output modulo 1000003.\n\n<h3>Input<\/h3>\n<\/p><p>Input file starts with a line containing a number T.

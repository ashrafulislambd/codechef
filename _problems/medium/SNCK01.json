In this row, the leftmost non zero number is chosen. Let this number be K. The player subtracts any number between 1 and K inclusive from it.<\/p>\n<p>4) The game ends when all the numbers in the matrix M are 0.<\/p>\n<p>5) The player who plays last wins the game.<\/p>\n<p>Given N,M and the initial matrix, determine who wins the game.<\/p>\n<p>Assume that both players play optimally.<\/p>\n<h3>Input:<\/h3>\n<p>The first line contains the number of test cases T.<\/p>\n<p>Each test case consists of 2 numbers N and M. There follow N lines each having M integers. The jth number on the ith line is the number M[i][j].<\/p>\n<p>There is a blank line between consecutive test cases.<\/p>\n<h3>Output:<\/h3>\n<p>Output T lines, one for each case. Output \"FIRST\" if player A wins, else output \"SECOND\".<\/p>\n<h3>Constraints :<\/h3>\n<p>T &lt;= 1000<\/p>\n<p>1 &lt;= N,M &lt;= 50<\/p>\n<p>The initial matrix values are between 1 and 50 inclusive.<\/p>\n<p>Time limit : 2 seconds.<\/p>\n<h3>Sample Input :<\/h3>\n<pre>3\n2 2\n1 1\n1 1\n\n1 3\n2 1 1\n\n2 2\n3 2\n3 2\n\n<\/pre>\n<h3>Sample Output:<\/h3>\n<pre>SECOND\nFIRST\nSECOND\n<br \/><br \/><br \/><\/pre>\n<p><\/p>    ","languages_supported":"NA","title":"SNCK01","category":"NA","old_version":true,"problem_code":"SNCK01"}

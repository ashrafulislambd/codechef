Then n lines follow each containing n characters defining the connectivity matrix of those islands. Character in column x of line y will be    1    if the islands with numbers x and y are connected and    0    otherwise. The next line is number p     the number of favorite bridges. The next p lines contain the pairs of islands that are connected by favorite bridges.\n\n<h3>Output<\/h3>\n<\/p><p>For each test case print the number of days Johnny will be happy in this situation.\n\n<h3>Constraints<\/h3>\n<\/p><p>1 &lt;= t &lt;= 5<br \/>\n2 &lt;= n &lt;= 30<br \/>\n1 &lt;= p &lt;= min(6, n-1)\n\n<h3>Example<\/h3>\n\n<pre>\n<b>Input:<\/b>\n1\n4\n0111\n1011\n1101\n1110\n2\n1 2\n3 4\n\n<b>Output:<\/b>\n4\n\n<\/pre><\/p>    ","languages_supported":"NA","title":"HAPPY","category":"NA","old_version":true,"problem_code":"HAPPY"}

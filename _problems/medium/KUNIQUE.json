{"body":"\n<h3> All submissions for this problem are available. <\/h3><p>A sequence of N integers is called K-unique if, when it is split into N\/K subsequences of K contiguous elements, each subsequence consists of K distinct integers.<\/p>\n\n<p>For example, consider this sequence of 6 integers.<br \/>\n(2, 10, 2, 8, 3, 6)<\/p>\n\n<p>This sequence is 2-unique, because when you split it into 3 subsequences each of 2 contiguous elements as below,<br \/>\n(2, 10), (2, 8), (3, 6),<\/p>\n\n<p>each subsequence consists of 2 distinct integers.<\/p>\n\n<p>You are given a sequence of N integers, and a positive integer K. Find a permutation of the sequence that is K-unique.<\/p>\n\n<h3>Input<\/h3>\n<p>The first line contains a single integer T, the number of test cases. T test cases follow. The first line of each test case contains two integers N and K. The next line contains a sequence of N integers a<sub>i<\/sub>, where a<sub>i<\/sub> is the i-th element of the sequence.<\/p>\n\n<h3>Output<\/h3>\n<p>For each test case, output a single line containing a permutation of the sequence that is K-unique. The elements of the sequence should be separated by a single space. If there are several solutions, output the lexicographically smallest one. If there is no solution, output -1.<\/p>\n\n<h3>Constraints<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>1 &lt;= T &lt;= 5<\/li>\n<li>1 &lt;= N &lt;= 50000<\/li>\n<li>1&lt;= K&lt;= N<\/li>\n<li>N will be divisible by K<\/li>\n<li>0 &lt;= a<sub>i<\/sub> &lt;= 1000000000<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<h3>Example<\/h3>\n<b>Input:<\/b>\n<pre>\n3\n1 1\n42\n4 2\n4 7 7 7\n6 2\n2 10 2 8 3 6\n<\/pre>\n<br \/>\n<b>Output:<\/b>\n<pre>\n42\n-1\n2 3 2 6 8 10\n<\/pre>    ","languages_supported":"NA","title":"KUNIQUE","category":"NA","old_version":true,"problem_code":"KUNIQUE"}

{"body":"\n<h3> All submissions for this problem are available. <\/h3><p>You own a large local restaurant. Because now it is very popular, you want to expand your restaurant in a neighboring country.<\/p>\n\n<p>The country consists N cities numbered 1 to N. There are N-1 roads connecting the cities. The country is efficiently organized, so there is exactly one path between every pairs of cities. No road will connect a city to itself.<\/p>\n\n<p>You want to build new restaurants in some cities. From an amateur survey, for each city i you know its profit index S<sub>i<\/sub>, that is the profit you will get if you build a new restaurant in city i.<\/p>\n\n<p>Initially, you have C chefs in city 1. You have D days to accomplish your expansion. On each day, you may perform exactly one of these options:<\/p>\n<p>\n<ul>\n<li>Do nothing.<\/li>\n<li>Transfer any number of chefs from a city to another city, provided that the two cities are connected by a road.<\/li>\n<li>Build a new restaurant in a city, provided that there is at least one chef in the city. After that, all chefs in the city cannot be transferred again. You can only build one restaurant per city.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/p>\n<br \/>\n<p>After D days has passed, you get the profit associated with a city if the city has a restaurant. Of course, you want the maximum possible total profit. Arrange your expansion plan in order to maximize your total profit.<\/p>\n\n<h3>Input<\/h3>\n<p>The first line contains three integers N, C, and D. The next line contains a sequence of N integers S<sub>i<\/sub>. The next N-1 lines contains two integers u<sub>i<\/sub> and v<sub>i<\/sub>, where u<sub>i<\/sub> and v<sub>i<\/sub> are the two cities connected by the i-th road.<\/p>\n\n<h3>Output<\/h3>\n<p>In the first line, output the maximum possible total profit. The next D lines contain your expansion plan. In each of the next D lines, output exactly one of the following (quotes for clarity).<\/p>\n<p>\n<ul>\n<li>\"<b>nothing<\/b>\", if you plan to do nothing on that day.<\/li>\n<li>\"<b>transfer<\/b> a b c\", if you plan to transfer c chefs from city a to city b on that day.<\/li>\n<li>\"<b>build<\/b> a\", if you plan to build a new restaurant in city a on that day.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/p>\n<br \/>\n\n<p>If there are several expansion plans that lead to the same maximum profit, you may output any.<\/p>\n\n<h3>Example<\/h3>\n<b>Input<\/b>\n<pre>\n4 2 5\n-10 5 2 6\n1 2\n2 3\n2 4\n<\/pre>\n<br \/>\n<b>Output<\/b>\n<pre>\n11\ntransfer 1 2 2\ntransfer 2 4 1\nnothing\nbuild 4\nbuild 2\n<\/pre>\n\n<h3>Constraints<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>1 &lt;= N &lt;= 30<\/li>\n<li>1 &lt;= C &lt;= 30<\/li>\n<li>1 &lt;= D &lt;= 30<\/li>\n<li>-1000 &lt;= S<sub>i<\/sub> &lt;= 1000<\/li>\n<li>1 &lt;= u<sub>i<\/sub> &lt;= N<\/li>\n<li>1 &lt;= v<sub>i<\/sub> &lt;= N<\/li>\n<li>u<sub>i<\/sub> != v<sub>i<\/sub><\/li>\n<li>There is exactly one path between every pair of cities<\/li>\n<\/ul>    ","languages_supported":"NA","title":"RESTEXP","category":"NA","old_version":true,"problem_code":"RESTEXP"}

All submissions for this problem are available.\*\*Jon Snow\*\* has to defeat the army of the \*\*Night King\*\*. For that he needs to increase the power of the \*\*Dragon Glass.\*\* Dragon Glass's power depends on certain numbers, described as follows. Dragon Glass follows its own number system, which comprises $Y$ integers ranging in $\[0,Y-1\]$. Normally, there are bases like base 2 (binary) , 8 (octal) , 10 (decimal) , etc. In this new number system, there are total $(X+1)$ bases, ranging from base $2$ to base $X+2$ in which these $Y$ numbers can be represented. Jon Snow initially has exactly $M$ \*\*distinct numbers\*\* in base $2$. $(1

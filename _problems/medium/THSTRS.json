The description of the test cases follows.\n- Each testcase consists of three lines which contain the strings $A, B, C$ respectively.\n\n### Output\nFor each test case, output an integer corresponding to the answer of the problem.\n\n###Constraints\n- $1 \\le T \\le 10^5$\n- $1 \\le |A|, |B|, |C| \\leq 2 * 10^5$\n- Each string consists only of lower case English alphabets ('a' to 'z')\n- Sum of the length of all three strings over all the testcases doesn't exceed $6 * 10^6$\n\n### Example Input\n```\n2\nabc\ncde\nbccd\nabc\ncde\ncec\n```\n\n### Example Output\n```\n6\n7\n```\n\n###Explanation:\n**Testcase 1**: Take $Z$ to be the empty string. So now, $A + Z + B$ becomes \"abccde\", and \"bccd\" is a substring of it. So this is a valid choice, and you can see that you cannot get a shorter string. Hence the answer is 6.\n\n**Testcase 2**: Take $Z$ = \"e\". So now, $A + Z + B$ becomes \"abcecde\", and \"cec\" is a substring of it. So this is a valid choice, and you can see that you cannot get a shorter string. Hence the answer is 7.","languages_supported":"C, CPP14, JAVA, PYTH, PYTH 3.6, PYPY, CS2, PAS fpc, PAS gpc, RUBY, PHP, GO, NODEJS, HASK, rust, SCALA, swift, D, PERL, FORT, WSPC, ADA, CAML, ICK, BF, ASM, CLPS, PRLG, ICON, SCM qobi, PIKE, ST, NICE, LUA, BASH, NEM, LISP sbcl, LISP clisp, SCM guile, JS, ERL, TCL, kotlin, PERL6, TEXT, SCM chicken, PYP3, CLOJ, COB, FS","max_timelimit":"1.75","source_sizelimit":"50000","problem_author":"admin2","problem_author_html_handle":"admin2","problem_tester":null,"problem_tester_html_handle":"","date_added":"17-12-2018","tags":"<a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/admin2'>admin2<\/a>","time":{"view_start_date":1545157800,"submit_start_date":1545157800,"visible_start_date":1545157800,"end_date":1735669800,"current":1559472984},"user":{"username":"","access":"default"},"todo":false,"problem_status":"unattempted","is_direct_submittable":false}

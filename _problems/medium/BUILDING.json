{"body":"\n<h3> All submissions for this problem are available. <\/h3><p>CodeChef Inc. owns a rectangular piece of land sized w\u00d7h.  Its edges are parallel to the axes, with the bottom-left corner at (0,0) and top-right corner at (w,h).  They intend to build a new head office within this land.  The new office will be a square whose center is located at a point with integer coordinates, and whose diagonals are parallel to the axes and have length 2*d.<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, there are n barricades on the land, some of which may need to be removed in order for the office to be built.  The (i)th barricade is located at (X<sub>i<\/sub>, Y<sub>i<\/sub>) and will cost C<sub>i<\/sub> to remove.  The office may only be built once all points it covers (including the boundaries) are free of barricades.<\/p>\n<h3>Request<\/h3>\n<p>Help them find the minimum total cost of barricade removal.<\/p>\n<h3>Input<\/h3>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The first line contains the integers w,h,d,n, respectively.<\/li>\n<li>Within following n lines, the i-th line contains the integers X<sub>i<\/sub>,Y<sub>i<\/sub>,C<sub>i<\/sub> respectively.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<h3>Output<\/h3>\n<p>Output on a single line an integer which is the minimum cost found.<\/p>\n<h3>Example<\/h3>\n<p><b>Input:<\/b><\/p>\n<pre>4 3 1 4<br \/>1 3 5<br \/>3 3 4<br \/>2 2 1<br \/>2 1 2<br \/><\/pre>\n<p><b>Output:<\/b><\/p>\n<pre>2<br \/><\/pre>\n<h3>Limitations<\/h3>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>2   &lt;= w,h   &lt;= 1 000<\/li>\n<li>0 &lt;=  n   &lt;= 200 000<\/li>\n<li>2   &lt;=2d   &lt;= min(w,h)<\/li>\n<li>0 &lt; C<sub>i<\/sub> &lt;= 10 000<\/li>\n<li>All the listed barricades are inside or on the boundaries of the CodeChef   s land.<\/li>\n<li>There is at most one barricade at each point.<\/li>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p><\/ul>    ","languages_supported":"NA","title":"BUILDING","category":"NA","old_version":true,"problem_code":"BUILDING"}

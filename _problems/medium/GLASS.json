{"body":"\n<h3> All submissions for this problem are available. <\/h3><h3> Statement <\/h3>\n\n<p>\nChef has n glasses each with a capacity of xi. <br \/>\nThere are Q+1 people playing a game including the Chef himself. Everyone at his\/her turn gives a positive integer M<sub>i<\/sub> and asks the Chef if volume M of water can be transferred using the n glasses with Chef. Chef at his own turn wants to give M as the highest integer volume which cannot be constructed using these n glasses. <br \/>\nSo, you need to help chef with this game. <br \/>\nAssume that to construct a volume M, we have a reserve with infinite volume of liquid. If Chef uses i<sup>th<\/sup> glass, he has to transfer a volume equal to xi in one turn. He can use a glass multiple times. However, transfer of liquid between glasses is not permitted. For example, you cannot obtain volume of 2 by tranferring liquid from glass of volume 5 to glass of volume 3. <br \/>\nIt is always possible to construct volume 0.\n<\/p>\n\n<h3> Input <\/h3> \nFirst line contains t ( \u2264 20 ) which is the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains n ( the number of glasses ) . The next line contains n space separated integers denoting the capacity of each glass. The next line contains a single integer Q - the number of players excluding the Chef. Then follows a line containing 3 space separated integers a,b,c. Calculate M<sub>i<\/sub> for the ith person as (a*i+b)%c ( i \u2265 1 ). \n<h3> Output <\/h3> \n\nFor each test case, the first line of output should contain the highest value M desired by Chef [ If there is no positive M, then output -1 ]. Then follows a line containing 2 integers A and B where A denotes the number of M<sub>i<\/sub> which cannot be constructed using the given glasses and B denotes the number of M<sub>i<\/sub> which can be constructed.\n\n<h3> Sample Input <\/h3> \n\n<pre>\n1\n2\n3 5\n2\n8 1 10\n\n<\/pre>\n\n<h3> Sample Output <\/h3>\n\n<pre>\n7\n1 1\n<\/pre>\n\n<h3> Constraints <\/h3>\n<p>\n1 &lt; n \u2264 10 <br \/>\n1 \u2264 xi \u2264 10<sup>7<\/sup> <br \/>\nMIN(xi) \u2264 100000 <br \/>\n1 \u2264 Q \u2264 1000000 <br \/>\n1 \u2264 a,c \u2264 10<sup>12<\/sup> <br \/>\n0 \u2264 b \u2264 10<sup>12<\/sup> <br \/>\n<\/p> \n<br \/>\n<h3> Sample Test Case Explanation <\/h3>\n<p> \nThere are 2 glasses of size 3 and 5. Volumes 1, 2, 4, 7 cannot be created by the combinations of glass suggested in the problem. Hence, the highest volume is 7. <br \/>\nThe 2 queries are for 9 and 7. 9 can be created using the glasses and 7 cannot. \n<\/p>\n    ","languages_supported":"NA","title":"GLASS","category":"NA","old_version":true,"problem_code":"GLASS"}

Just Yesterday he made terrible food and hence got beaten up. He has hence decided that he wont prepare food himself but instead collect food from hotels in the city. <br \/>\nHowever, he suffered injury on his head ( people can get really angry when served with bad food  ) and is suffering from short term memory loss. \nHe is standing in a city in the form of a grid where cell(i,j) of the grid contains a hotel which has G<sub>ij<\/sub> amount of food to offer to the chef. Every second, Chef goes to one of the neighbors in the grid.  ( Note: Please note that any cell(i,j) can have atmost 4 neighbors). <br \/>\nUnfortunately, due to short term memory loss, he throws away whatever he is given every alternate second. That is he throws away food given at t = 0 , keeps food given at t = 1, throws away food given at t = 2, and so forth. <br \/>\nThe grid also has some added constraints. No hotel ( or cell ) can be visited more than once. Since, Chef has weak memory, he must return to his kitchen ( which is also his starting point ) after collecting the food. <br \/>\nYou have to help the Chef choose a path such that the amount of food collected is maximized [ The path should be such that no two cell in the path are same except for the start and end of the path which <b>have to be<\/b> the same ]. <br \/> \n<b>The Chef can choose the kitchen ( starting point ) to be located in any of the four corners of the grid.<\/b><br \/>\n<\/p>\n\n<h3> Input <\/h3>\n<p>\nThe first line contains t ( &lt;= 100 ) which denotes the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains 2 space separared integers n,m which denote the dimension of the matrix. Then n lines follow, each containing m space separared integers. jth integer on the ith line denotes G<sub>ij<\/sub> <br \/>\n<b> Warning :  Enormous Input\/Output. <\/b><br \/>\n<\/p>\n\n<h3> Output <\/h3> \n<p>\nFor each test case, the first line of output should contain a number denoting the maximum amount of food the Chef can collect. The second line of output should contain the length of the path Chef takes ( L )  for the mentioned amount of food. Then follow L lines, where the ith line contains 2 space separated integers ( 0 based ) denoting the cell number of the ith cell in the path. <br \/>\nIf there are multiple such optimal paths, any path would suffice. <br \/>\n<b>Note<\/b> : The first and last cell of the path are the same ( The Chef returns to his starting point ) . <br \/> \n<\/p>\n\n<h3> Sample Input <\/h3>\n<br \/>\n<pre>\n1 \n2 2\n2 3\n3 2\n<\/pre>\n\n<h3> Sample Output <\/h3>\n<br \/>\n<pre>\n6\n5\n0 0 \n0 1\n1 1 \n1 0\n0 0\n<\/pre>\n\n<h3> Constraints <\/h3>\n<p>\n1 &lt; m*n \u2264 100000 <br \/>\n0 \u2264 G<sub>ij<\/sub> \u2264 10000 <br \/>\n<\/p>    ","languages_supported":"NA","title":"GRIDCHEF","category":"NA","old_version":true,"problem_code":"GRIDCHEF"}

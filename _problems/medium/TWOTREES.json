{"category_name":"medium","status":"success","problem_code":"TWOTREES","problem_name":"A tale of two trees","body":"<span class=\"solution-visible-txt\">All submissions for this problem are available.<\/span>\n<p>There are two trees; tree 1 has <b>N<sub>1<\/sub><\/b> nodes which are numbered from 1 to <b>N<sub>1<\/sub><\/b>, and tree 2 has <b>N<sub>2<\/sub><\/b> nodes which are numbered from 1 to <b>N<sub>2<\/sub><\/b>. Each tree is rooted at its node 1.<\/p>\n\n<p>You should perform the following operation: choose an arbitrary node <b>u<\/b> in tree 2, remove the subtree of node <b>u<\/b> (the subtree formed by node <b>u<\/b> and all its direct or indirect descendants) from tree 2 and add the subtree to any leaf of tree 1 (ie. <b>u<\/b> should become a child of some leaf in tree 1). Note that  <b>u<\/b> can also be the root of tree 2. Afterwards, discard the rest of tree 2 and keep only the modified tree 1. How many distinct trees can you obtain by performing this operation exactly once?<\/p>\n\n<p>Note that tree 1 will remain rooted in its own node 1. Two trees are considered identical if you can reorder (without changing the root) the children in each node and renumber the nodes (except the root) to make them equal. (Intuitively, the structure of the trees must be same - we're dealing with rooted, unlabelled, unordered isomorphic trees.)<\/p>\n\n<h3>Input<\/h3>\n<p>The first line of the input contains an integer <b>T<\/b> denoting the number of test cases.

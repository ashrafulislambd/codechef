{"body":"\n<h3> All submissions for this problem are available. <\/h3><p>\nA string is called beautiful if it has the form <b>AA<sup>r<\/sup>AA<sup>r<\/sup><\/b> where <b>A<\/b> is some non-empty string and <b>A<sup>r<\/sup><\/b> is the reversed <b>A<\/b>.\nYou are given a string <b>S<\/b> composed only of lowercase letters of the English alphabet. Find the number of its beautiful substrings. Equal substrings in different positions are considered different. For example, the string <b>aaaaa<\/b> has <b>2<\/b> different substrings because we have beautiful substring <b>aaaa<\/b> in two different positions.\n\n<h3>Input<\/h3>\n<\/p><p> The first line contains a single integer <b>T &lt;= 10<\/b>, the number of test cases. <b>T<\/b> test cases follow. The only line of each test case contains a non-empty string composed only of lowercase letters of the English alphabet. The length of the string is not greater than <b>100000<\/b>.\n\n<h3>Output<\/h3>\n<\/p><p> For each test case, output a single line containing the number of beautiful substrings of the corresponding string.\n\n<h3>Example<\/h3>\n\n<pre>\n<b>Input:<\/b>\n6\naaaa\naaaaa\nabbaabba\nabbaabb\nabaaba\nxxyyxxxxyyxx\n\n<b>Output:<\/b>\n1\n2\n1\n0\n0\n2\n<\/pre><\/p>    ","languages_supported":"NA","title":"PALIPALI","category":"NA","old_version":true,"problem_code":"PALIPALI"}

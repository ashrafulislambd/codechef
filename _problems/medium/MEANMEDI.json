One would wish Chef's ego wouldn't \tcome in the way, but Chef has taken up the challenge to prove otherwise. He asks for your help. Given N numbers, select \tK out of them, such that, the absolute difference between the mean and the median of the selected numbers, is as low \tas possible.<\/p>\n<p>Mean of K numbers is defined as the sum of the numbers divided by K.<\/p>\n<p>Median of K numbers is defined as the number that appears at the order index, floor((K+1)\/2); \tthat is, the I'th element in the sorted order of the K numbers (where numbering starts from 1), \twhere I = floor((K+1)\/2). Note that, if K is even, the median would be the smaller value among the two values that \tlie in the center.<\/p>\n<h3>Input format<\/h3>\n<p>The first line contains the number T, the number of test cases. In the following lines, \tT test cases follow (without any newlines between them.) Each case consists of only 2 lines. The first line of each test case contains N and K, separated by a single space. The second line contains N positive integers, separated by a single space.<\/p>\n<h3>Output format<\/h3>\n<p>For each test case, print the minimum absolute difference between the mean and the median \tthat you can get, by selecting any K numbers, from the N numbers. Output the result rounded to 3 digits of precision \tafter the decimal.<\/p>\n<h3>Constraints<\/h3>\n<p>1 \u2264 T \u2264 20<br \/> 1 \u2264 N \u2264 60<br \/> 1 \u2264 K \u2264 N<br \/> 1 \u2264 numbers \u2264 1200<\/p>\n<h3>Sample input<\/h3>\n<pre>2\n8 2\n4 9 1 3 5 9 4 10\n5 4\n10 7 4 5 9\n\n<\/pre>\n<h3>Sample output<\/h3>\n<pre>0.000\n0.500\n\n<\/pre>\n<h3>Explanation<\/h3>\n<p>In the first case, you can select [4, 4].<\/p>\n<p>In the second case, you can select [10, 7, 4, 9].

A bipartite graph with $n$ vertices on the left part (numbered from 1 to $n$) and $m$ on the right part (numbered from $n+1$ to $n + m$), is said to be a Range Graph, if each vertex on the left satisfies the following property - the numbers of its set of neighbors should form a consecutive range\/segment on the right.\n\nFor example, suppose $n$ = 10 and $m$ = 13. Then the vertices on the left are {1, 2, ..., 10} and the ones on the right are {11, 12, ..., 23}. Now, suppose the neighbors of vertex 7 were {12, 14, 15, 19}, then this would not be a Range Graph, because they aren't consecutive numbers. So for it to be a Range Graph, the neighbors could potentially be, say, {12, 13, 14, 15}.\n\nYour task is to find the total number of **connected** Range Graphs which have $n$ vertices on left and $m$ on the right. Output your answer modulo $10^9 + 7$. \n\nNote that two Range Graphs are considered to be different if there are two vertices i and j such that one of the graphs has an edge between them, but the other graph doesn't. In other words, the edge set should be different. A graph is said to be connected if every vertex is reachable from every other vertex through some sequence of edges.\n\n**Note: The source limit (ie. the size of your program file) for this problem is lower than usual.

It will have an edge between vertices 1 and 2, and also between vertices 1 and 3.\n\n**Example 2** Here are the five possible connected Range Graphs with 2 vertices on left and right:\n\n<img height=\"350\" src=\"https:\/\/codechef_shared.s3.amazonaws.com\/download\/ACMINO18\/BIPFAMIL\/1.png\"\/>","languages_supported":"C, CPP14, JAVA, PYTH, PYTH 3.6, PYPY","max_timelimit":"3","source_sizelimit":"10000","problem_author":"admin2","problem_author_html_handle":"admin2","problem_tester":null,"problem_tester_html_handle":"","date_added":"18-10-2018","tags":"<a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/admin2'>admin2<\/a>","time":{"view_start_date":1540314000,"submit_start_date":1540314000,"visible_start_date":1540314000,"end_date":1735669800,"current":1559472969},"user":{"username":"","access":"default"},"todo":false,"problem_status":"unattempted","is_direct_submittable":false}

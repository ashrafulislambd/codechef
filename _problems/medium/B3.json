Your goal is to destroy as many of the guns as possible.<\/p>\n<p>The battle field is a 2D Cartesian grid, where your cannon is located at the origin.<\/p>\n<p>The enemy battleship is a horizontal line segment located from the coordinates (X1 , Y) to (X2, Y).<br \/>\nThere are exactly (X2 - X1 + 1) guns on the ship, located at the integer points (X1, Y), (X1+1, Y), ..., (X2, Y).\n<\/p>\n<p>\nHowever, the problem is, you cannot always fire at a gun. There are supernatural rocks located at all points of the battlefield whose X and Y coordinates are both integers. In order to fire successfully at an enemy's gun, the line connecting your cannon and that gun must not<br \/>\ngo through any rocks.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nHow many guns you successfully destroy?\n<\/p>\n<h3>Input<\/h3>\n<p>\nThe first line contains t, the number of test cases (about 100). Then t test cases follow.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nEach test case consists of one line containing three numbers Y, and X1, X2 (2100000000 > &#8804; Y &#8804; 2100000000, -2100000000 &#8804; X <sub>1<\/sub> &#8804; X<sub>2<\/sub> &#8804; 2100000000).\n<\/p>\n<h3>Output<\/h3>\n<p>\nFor each test case, output the number of the enemy battleship's guns that your cannon can destroy.\n<\/p>\n<h3>Example<\/h3>\n<pre>\n<b>Input<\/b>\n1\n2 -2 1\n\n\n<b>Output<\/b>\n2\n<\/pre>    ","languages_supported":"NA","title":"B3","category":"NA","old_version":true,"problem_code":"B3"}

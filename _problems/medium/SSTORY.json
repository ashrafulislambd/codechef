(apparentely, opposites attract, alikes repel right?)<\/p>\n<p>However, as Lira didn't want to lose contact with her, she decided to mix Art and Computer Science one last time and amaze her friend with Computer Science, so she could have a geek coding partner.<\/p>\n<p>To amaze her, she encoded a message in two strings, which she presented to her friend:<\/p>\n<p>Lira: \"So, Mary, as you can see, we have two strings here, yes? We have a first longer string, <b>S1<\/b>, which encodes our common path together, and is represented by some letters which represent our lives so far as well all the events we lived together.<\/p>\n<p>The second string, <b>S2<\/b>, will be as long as the first one, or possibly shorter and it is here to represent what the future might bring to both of us :) It is also only composed of letters, which represent some life events we might still experience together in the future.<\/p>\n<p>What I would like you to do, is to find out if the future will be just like now, and, for that,you need to find a contiguous sequence of letters in both of these two strings.<\/p>\n<p>Obviously, as I want our friendship to last very, very much, I ask you to find the longest sequence of life events we might still experience together  and tell me which sequence is it and how long is it :D<\/p>\n<p>However, if fate doesn't want us to be together, simply tell me the number 0 and we shall both head separate ways forever.<\/p>\n<p>Turns out, that after Mary solved the problem, she became so interested in CS herself, that both she and Lira are now working together at a very reputable software company. :) <\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<h3>Input<\/h3>\n<p>The input will consist of two strings composed only of the letters <b>a..z<\/b>, both of which are at most 250.000 characters in length.<\/p>\n<h3>Output<\/h3>\n<p>The output should be as stated.<\/p>\n<p>If there is a common life event in Mary and Lira's lives, you should output it on a single line and, on another line, you should output the length of the event.<\/p>\n<p>Otherwise, simply output 0.<\/p>\n<p><b>\n<p>On the case where there are multiple answers, the first common event to be found on the second string, should be written to output, followed by its length.

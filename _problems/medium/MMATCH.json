{"body":"\n<h3> All submissions for this problem are available. <\/h3><p>\nThere is a school trip being organized for kids.\nThe hotel the group is staying in can offer them one big room with enough beds to suit any group of visitors, and several smaller rooms with B beds alltogether.\nThe children have heard many strange and frightening stories about the big room. That's why not even one of them wants to sleep in the big room.\nFurthermore not every kid would like to sleep in any bed. \n<br \/><br \/>\nYour goal is to assign B beds from the smaller rooms in such a way\nthat the maximal number of children are happy (a child is happy when it gets to sleep in one of the beds it has selected).<\/p>\n<h3>Input<\/h3>\n<p>\nThe first line contains a positive integer t&lt;=1000 indicating the number of test cases.\nEach test case is an instance of the problem defined above.\nThe first line of each test case is a pair of positive integers L and B (the number of children L&lt;=100 and beds B&lt;=100).\nThe next lines contain a sequence of (c,b) pairs ending with two zeros.\n(c,b) means that the child c will be happy if it gets to sleep in bed b.\n<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Output<\/h3>\n<p>For each test case print the maximal number of happy children.\n<\/p>\n\n<h3>Example<\/h3>\n\n<pre>\n<b>Input:<\/b>\n3\n3 3\n1 1\n2 1\n2 2\n3 2\n3 3\n0 0\n4 3\n1 1\n1 3\n2 1\n3 1\n3 2\n4 2\n0 0\n4 2\n1 1\n1 2\n2 1\n2 2\n3 1\n3 2\n4 1\n4 2\n0 0\n\n\n<b>Output:<\/b>\n3\n3\n2\n<\/pre>    ","languages_supported":"NA","title":"MMATCH","category":"NA","old_version":true,"problem_code":"MMATCH"}

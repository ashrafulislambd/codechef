As that friend visits\nthat house, he'll be locked in that house.  That is, Crane's mother wants to find a \nsequence <strong>block<\/strong> such that\nthe <strong>i-th<\/strong> friend will be locked in <strong>block[i]-th<\/strong> house \nonce he visits that house. As she wants to ensure that there is at maximum one\nperson in each house, she must choose the sequence <strong>block<\/strong> such\nthat if friend A visits house H at time T, and he is locked away in the house, then no other friends visit house H\nafter time T. \n\n\nHelp Crane's mother to find such a sequence <strong>block<\/strong>. \n\n<h3>Input<\/h3>\nFirst line contains a single integer <strong>n<\/strong> (1 \u2264 <strong>n<\/strong>\n\u2264 100), indicating the number of friends and houses.\n\nThen <strong>n<\/strong> lines follow, with each line containing <strong>n<\/strong> positive integers.\nThe <strong>j-th<\/strong> integer in <strong>i-th<\/strong> line indicates the time when the <strong>i-th<\/strong> friend will visit the <strong>j-th<\/strong> house. All times will fit in signed 32-bit integer.\n\n<h3>Output<\/h3>\nIf there exists a sequence <strong>block<\/strong> that satisfies the constraints, then output <strong>block[1] block[2] ... block[n]<\/strong> in one line, separated by a single space.\n\nOtherwise if there is no such sequence, output <strong>-1<\/strong> in one line.\nIf there are multiple answers, then anyone will do.\n\n<h3>Example<\/h3>\n\n<pre>\n<b>Input:<\/b>\n3\n1 2 3\n4 5 6\n7 8 9\n\n<b>Output:<\/b>\n3 2 1\n<\/pre>","languages_supported":"ADA, ASM, BASH, BF, C, C99 strict, CAML, CLOJ, CLPS, CPP 4.3.2, CPP 4.9.2, CPP14, CS2, D, ERL, FORT, FS, GO, HASK, ICK, ICON, JAVA, JS, LISP clisp, LISP sbcl, LUA, NEM, NICE, NODEJS, PAS fpc, PAS gpc, PERL, PERL6, PHP, PIKE, PRLG, PYTH, PYTH 3.4, RUBY, SCALA, SCM guile, SCM qobi, ST, TCL, TEXT, WSPC","max_timelimit":"1","source_sizelimit":"50000","problem_author":"shangjingbo","problem_author_html_handle":"<span \n            class='rating' \n            style='display: inline-block; \n                    font-size: 10px; \n                    background: #3366CC;\n                    padding: 0 3px; \n                    line-height: 1.3; \n                    color: white;\n                    margin-right: 2px;'>3&#9733;<\/span><span>shangjingbo<\/span>","problem_tester":"laycurse","problem_tester_html_handle":"<span \n            class='rating' \n            style='display: inline-block; \n                    font-size: 10px; \n                    background: #FF7F00;\n                    padding: 0 3px; \n                    line-height: 1.3; \n                    color: white;\n                    margin-right: 2px;'>6&#9733;<\/span><span>laycurse<\/span>","date_added":"26-06-2012","tags":"<a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/aug12'>\n                    aug12\n                <\/a><a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/graph'>\n                    graph\n                <\/a><a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/matching'>\n                    matching\n                <\/a><a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/shangjingbo'>\n                    shangjingbo\n                <\/a>","editorial_url":"http:\/\/discuss.codechef.com\/problems\/BLOCKING","user":{"username":null},"time":{"view_start_date":1344676996,"submit_start_date":1344676996,"visible_start_date":1344677400,"end_date":1735669800,"current":1493557491},"todo":false,"problem_status":"unattempted"}

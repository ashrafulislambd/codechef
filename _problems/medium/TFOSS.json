{"body":"\n<h3> All submissions for this problem are available. <\/h3>\n<p>A small group of archaeologists is working in the Antarctic. Their sensors have detected a number of caves in which there are interesting fossils. However, a thick layer of ice blocks the entrance to each cave. The archaeologists possess the equipment needed to burn a tunnel in the layer of ice, but the fuel is extremely expensive. In order to determine the size of each fossil the group has launched a number of probes through small bore-holes. <\/p>\n<p>Each probe which hits a fossil emits a signal consisting of its x and y coordinates. Your task is to determine the smallest possible size of the tunnel, which is equal to the maximum distance between any two probes (so that the fossil won&#8217;t be damaged during extraction). The drilling equipment requiers the squared value of this distance.<\/p>\n<p>Given a list of coordinates of points containing probes, find the square of the maximum distance between any two probes. <\/p>\n<h3>Input<\/h3>\n<pre>\n<p>t [the number of tests &lt;= 20]\n[empty line]\nn [the number of active probes &lt;= 100000]\nx<sub>1<\/sub> y<sub>1<\/sub> [coordinates of the first probe]\n...\nx<sub>n<\/sub> x<sub>n<\/sub>\n[integer coordinates from -50000000 to 50000000]\n[empty line]\n[input for the next test cases...]\n<\/p><\/pre><p><h3>Output<\/h3>\n<pre>o<sub>1<\/sub> [the square of the maximal distance in the first set]\no<sub>n<\/sub> [output for the next test cases...]\n<\/pre><h3>Example<\/h3>\n<pre>\n<b>Input:<\/b>\n5\n\n1\n2 -3\n\n4\n0 0\n-2 2\n2 2\n1 0\n\n6\n-4 2\n2 2\n5 0\n0 5\n6 1\n-1 -1\n\n10\n0 0\n5 1\n9 2\n12 3\n14 4\n15 5\n16 7\n17 10\n18 14\n19 19\n\n10\n2 -3\n-1 2\n0 5\n-5 -1\n-4 2\n4 0\n1 3\n4 3\n-3 -4\n0 -2\n\n<b>Output:<\/b>\n0\n16\n101\n722\n98\n<\/pre><\/p>    ","languages_supported":"NA","title":"TFOSS","category":"NA","old_version":true,"problem_code":"TFOSS"}

That is, you cannot start at a node, follow some of the roads and return back to the same node.\n\nJon has to stop the army of the dead.     \nAll white walkers are standing at **node** $1$ right now.  \n\nFor this, he decided to carry out $Q$ steps of two different types -     \n\n- $1$   $K$  \n   Add value $K$ to the power required to travel each road in Winterfell. i.e after this operation $C_i = C_i + K$  $ \\forall$ $i$  $\\epsilon [1,M]$ . Value $K$ can be negative as well.  \n- $2$ $Y$   \n   Find the minimum power required for the white walkers to reach node $Y$ in Winterfell from node $1$.     \n\nHelp Jon is finding out the answer for each query of type $2$.  \n\n###Input:\n\n- First line will contain 2 space separated integers - $N$ and $M$, number of nodes , and the number of roads in Winterfell.  \n- M lines follow. Each of the lines comprises 3 space separated integers  - $A_i$, $B_i$ and $C_i$, denoting that $i^{th}$ road is directed from node $A_i$ to $B_i$ with initial power required to travel this road being $C_i$.  \n- Next line comprises $Q$ - the number of queries.  \n- Q lines follow. Each query is of the type as described above, and will comprise 2 space separated integers. For type $1$, the second integer will be $K$ - the amount of power added to each road. For type $2$, the second integer will be $Y$ - the node to reach from node $1$.\n\n###Output:\nFor each query of type $2$, output in a single line answer to the minimum power required for white walkers at node $1$ to reach node $Y$.   \nIf there is no way to reach node $Y$, output **\"No Path Exists\" (without quotes)** . \n\n###Constraints \n- $1 \\leq N \\leq 3000$\n- $1 \\leq M \\leq 7000$  \n- $1 \\leq Q \\leq 5*10^6$    \n- $1 \\leq A_i, B_i \\leq N, A_i != B_i$  \n- $-10^9 \\leq C_i, K \\leq 10^9$\n- $1 \\leq Y \\leq N$ \n- At any point of time, the power required to travel on each road will always be $[-10^{12}, 10^{12}]$    \n\n###Sample Input:  \n3 3    \n1 2 1       \n1 3 3     \n2 3 2        \n3     \n2 3   \n1 2   \n2 3   \n\n###Sample Output:   \n3   \n5  \n\t\n###EXPLANATION:\nInitially, the road to reach node $3$ with minimum power is either $( 1 \\rightarrow 2, 2 \\rightarrow 3)$ or $( 1 \\rightarrow 3 )$, each amounting to total power = $3$.   \nThen, the power requirement of each edge is increased by $2$.  \nSo, now the road $(1 \\rightarrow 2, 2 \\rightarrow  3)$ requires total power = $3+4=7$.  \nThe road $(1 \\rightarrow 3)$ requires total power = $5$. \n","languages_supported":"C, CPP14, JAVA, PYTH, PYTH 3.6, PYPY, CS2, PAS fpc, PAS gpc, RUBY, PHP, GO, NODEJS, HASK, rust, SCALA, swift, D, PERL, FORT, WSPC, ADA, CAML, ICK, BF, ASM, CLPS, PRLG, ICON, SCM qobi, PIKE, ST, NICE, LUA, BASH, NEM, LISP sbcl, LISP clisp, SCM guile, JS, ERL, TCL, kotlin, PERL6, TEXT, SCM chicken, PYP3, CLOJ, R, COB, FS","max_timelimit":"1.5","source_sizelimit":"50000","problem_author":"shivamg_isc","problem_author_html_handle":"<span \n            class='rating' \n            style='display: inline-block; \n                    font-size: 10px; \n                    background: #FFBF00;\n                    padding: 0 3px; \n                    line-height: 1.3; \n                    color: white;\n                    margin-right: 2px;'>5&#9733;<\/span><span>shivamg_isc<\/span>","problem_tester":null,"problem_tester_html_handle":"","date_added":"5-04-2019","tags":"<a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/shivamg_isc'>shivamg_isc<\/a>","time":{"view_start_date":1554669000,"submit_start_date":1554669000,"visible_start_date":1554669000,"end_date":1735669800,"current":1559472984},"user":{"username":"","access":"default"},"todo":false,"problem_status":"unattempted","is_direct_submittable":false}

If no such string is possible, output `\"impossible\"` without quotes. If there are multiple answers, print any.\n\n###Input:\n\n- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. \n- Each testcase contains of a single line of input, which has two integers, $n$ and $k$, separated by space\n\n###Output:\nFor each testcase, output any balanced parenthesis string which satisfies the condition or `\"impossible\"` if no such string exists.\n\n###Constraints \n- $1 \\leq T \\leq 5000$\n- $1 \\leq n \\leq 200$\n- $1 \\leq k \\leq 10^5$\n\n###Sample Input:\n\t3\n\t2 1\n\t5 3\n\t6 4\n\n###Sample Output:\n\t()\n\timpossible\n\t()(())\n\t\n###EXPLANATION:\nCase 1: The entire string is also considered as its own substring so there is exactly 1 balanced substring: `()` itself\n\nCase 2: No balanced string with length 5 exists\n\nCase 3: There are exactly 4 substrings that are balanced (indices are 0 based):\n1. Substring 0 to 1: `()`\n2. Substring 3 to 4: `()`\n3. Substring 2 to 5: `(())`\n4. Substring 0 to 5: `()(())`\n","languages_supported":"C, CPP14, JAVA, PYTH, PYTH 3.6, PYPY, PYP3","max_timelimit":"1","source_sizelimit":"50000","problem_author":"balajiganapath","problem_author_html_handle":"<span \n            class='rating' \n            style='display: inline-block; \n                    font-size: 10px; \n                    background: #FF7F00;\n                    padding: 0 3px; \n                    line-height: 1.3; \n                    color: white;\n                    margin-right: 2px;'>6&#9733;<\/span><span>balajiganapath<\/span>","problem_tester":null,"problem_tester_html_handle":"","date_added":"25-12-2018","tags":"<a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/balajiganapath'>balajiganapath<\/a>","time":{"view_start_date":1546074900,"submit_start_date":1546074900,"visible_start_date":1546074900,"end_date":1735669800,"current":1559472967},"user":{"username":"","access":"default"},"todo":false,"problem_status":"unattempted","is_direct_submittable":false}

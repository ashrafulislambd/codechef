All submissions for this problem are available.\### Read problems statements in \[Hindi\](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/COOK106/hindi/COLORDIS.pdf), \[Mandarin Chinese\](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/COOK106/mandarin/COLORDIS.pdf), \[Russian\](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/COOK106/russian/COLORDIS.pdf), \[Vietnamese\](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/COOK106/vietnamese/COLORDIS.pdf) and \[Bengali\](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/COOK106/bengali/COLORDIS.pdf) as well. You have to process $Q$ queries on a rooted tree. Each node of the tree has a label and a color. Initially, the tree consists of a single node (the root) with label $1$ and color $c\_0$. There are two types of queries: 1. You are given an existing node $u$ and a color $c$. Let's denote the number of nodes in the tree before this query by $k$. Create a node with label $k+1$ and color $c$, and add it to the tree as a child of node $u$. 2. You are given a node $u$ and a color $c$. For each node with color $c$ (possibly including $u$), find its distance from node $u$. The answer to this query is the minimum of these distances, or $-1$ if there are no nodes with color $c$ in the tree. The input is encoded so that you have to process these queries online. ### Input - The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows. - The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $Q$ and $c\_0$. - Each of the following $Q$ lines contains a character $t$ followed by a space and two space-separated integers $u'$ and $c'$ describing a query. - The character $t$ is '+' for a query of the first type or '?' for a query of the second type. - Let's denote the answer to the last query of the second type by $a$ ($a = -1$ if there have been no queries of the second type so far). The parameters $u$ and $c$ of the current query can be computed as $u = u' \\oplus (a+1)$ and $c = c' \\oplus (a+1)$. ### Output For each query of the second type, print a single line containing one integer â€” the answer to this query. ### Constraints - $1 \\le Q \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$ - the sum of $Q$ over all test cases does not exceed $4 \\cdot 10^5$ - $t$ is '+' or '?' - $u$ is a valid label of a node in the tree - $1 \\le c\_0, c \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$ ### Example Input ``` 2 6 1 + 1 2 + 2 3 + 3 1 ? 1 3 ? 7 2 ? 3 0 10 1 + 1 2 ? 1 1 ? 3 0 ? 0 6 + 2 3 + 2 4 ? 3 4 + 0 7 ? 0 7 ? 3 6 ``` ### Example Output ``` 2 0 1 0 1 -1 2 1 2 ``` ### Explanation \*\*Example case 1:\*\* The decoded queries are ``` + 1 2 + 2 3 + 3 1 ? 1 3 ? 4 1 ? 2 1 ``` \*\*Example case 2:\*\* The decoded queries are ``` + 1 2 ? 1 1 ? 2 1 ? 2 4 + 2 3 + 2 4 ? 3 4 + 3 4 ? 3 4 ? 1 4 ```

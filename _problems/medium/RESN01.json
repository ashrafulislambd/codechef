{"body":"\n<h3> All submissions for this problem are available. <\/h3><p><b>Problem statement updated.<\/b><\/p>\n<p>You are given a cyclic array A having N numbers.  In an AND round, each element of the array A is replaced by the bitwise AND of itself, the previous element, and the next element in the array. All operations take place simultaneously. Can you calculate A after K such AND rounds ?<\/p>\n<h3>Input<\/h3>\n<p>The first line contains the number of test cases T (T &lt;= 50).  There follow 2T lines, 2 per test case. The first line contains two space seperated integers N (3 &lt;= N &lt;= 20000) and K (1 &lt;= K &lt;= 1000000000). The next line contains N space seperated integers Ai (0 &lt;= Ai &lt;= 1000000000), which are the initial values of the elements in array A.<\/p>\n<h3>Output<\/h3>\n<p>Output T lines, one per test case. For each test case, output a space seperated list of N integers, specifying the contents of array A after K AND rounds.<\/p>\n<h3>Example<\/h3>\n<pre><b>Input:<\/b>\n2\n3 1\n1 2 3\n5 100\n1 11 111 1111 11111\n<b>Output:<\/b>\n0 0 0\n1 1 1 1 1\n<\/pre>\n<p><\/p>    ","languages_supported":"NA","title":"RESN01","category":"NA","old_version":true,"problem_code":"RESN01"}

You have to perform two types of operations :\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\n1) Increase the numbers between indices A and B by 1. This is represented by the command \"0 A B\"\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\n2) Answer how many numbers between indices A and B are divisible by 3. This is represented by the command \"1 A B\".\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nInput :\n<\/p>\n<p>\nThe first line contains two integers, N and Q. Each of the next Q lines are either of the form \"0 A B\" or \"1 A B\" as mentioned above.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nOutput :\n<\/p>\n<p>\nOutput 1 line for each of the queries of the form \"1 A B\" containing the required answer for the corresponding query.\n<\/p>\n\n<pre>\nSample Input :\n4 7\n1 0 3\n0 1 2\n0 1 3\n1 0 0\n0 0 3\n1 3 3\n1 0 3\n\n<\/pre>\n<pre>\nSample Output :\n4\n1\n0\n2\n\n<\/pre>\n\n<pre>\nConstraints :\n1 &lt;= N &lt;= 100000\n1 &lt;= Q &lt;= 100000\n0 &lt;= A &lt;= B &lt;= N - 1\n<\/pre>    ","languages_supported":"NA","title":"MULTQ3","category":"NA","old_version":true,"problem_code":"MULTQ3"}

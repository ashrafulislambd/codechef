{"body":"\n<h3> All submissions for this problem are available. <\/h3><p>Dave recently mastered the problem of placing N queens on a chessboard so\nthat no two queens attack eachother.\nNow he wants to see how many knights he can place on a chessboard so\nthat no two knights attack eachother.\nNormally this would be a simple task, but some of the squares of the\nchessboard have been marked as unusable and hence cannot have a knight placed\non them.<\/p>\n<p>Recall that a knight can attack another knight if their vertical distance\nis 2 and their horizontal distance is 1, or if their vertical distance is 1 and\ntheir horizontal distance is 2.  Only one knight may be placed on each square\nof the chessboard<\/p>\n\n<h3>Input<\/h3>\n<p>The first line of input contains an integer T (0&lt;T\u226450), the number of test cases to follow.<\/p>\n<p>Each test case will begin with a line containing 2 integers M and N (0&lt;M,N\u226430), \ndenoting the number of rows and columns, respectively.\nM lines follow, each containing exactly N characters.\nThe j-th character of the i-th line is '.' if a knight may be placed in the j-th column of the i-th\nrow, and '#' if the square is unusable.<\/p>\n\n<h3>Output<\/h3>\n<p>For each test case, output on a single line the maximum number of knights that may be placed\non the chessboard such that no two attack eachother.<\/p>\n\n<h3>Sample input:<\/h3>\n<pre><code>2\n2 4\n....\n....\n5 5\n..#..\n#..#.\n##...\n...##\n.....\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n<h3>Sample output:<\/h3>\n<pre>4\n11\n\n<\/pre>\n\n<p>The following image represents the chessboard and a possible solution to the second test case:<br \/>\n<img src=\"http:\/\/www.codechef.com\/download\/board.png\" alt=\"nn#_n\n#n_#n\n##__n\n_n_##\nnnn_n\" \/><\/p>    ","languages_supported":"NA","title":"KNIGHTS","category":"NA","old_version":true,"problem_code":"KNIGHTS"}

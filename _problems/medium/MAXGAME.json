All of these \n    players would stand in a circle in clock wise direction.\n    <\/li>\n\n    <li>\n    There are an infinite number of long ropes available.\n    When a rope is held by exactly two players, it is termed as bonding.\n    <\/li>\n\n    <li>\n    At least one bonding is necessary to conduct a game.\n    <\/li>\n\n    <li>\n    A player can play against multiple people simultaneously i.e he can have more than one bonding at\n    the same time. \n    <\/li>\n\n    <li>\n    Both members of a pair of players that have a bonding must have the same number of total\n    bondings. That is, if the player <i>A<\/i>  makes bonding with the player <i>B<\/i>,\n    then the number of total bondings of the player <i>A<\/i> must be the same as\n    that of the player <i>B<\/i>.\n    <\/li>\n\n    <li>\n    Bondings should be created in such a fashion that ropes must not intersect each other. \n    <\/li>\n\n    <li>\n    The number of bondings of every player must be no more than <b>K<\/b>.\n    <\/li>\n\n<\/ol>\n\n<\/p><p>\nNow Master Chef Oogway asked Chef Shifu and Chef Po to find out the number of possible games.\nYour task is to help them find this number. As this number might become huge,\nyou've to find it modulo (10^14+7). Two games are different iff there is some\nbonding that is present in only of them. \n\n\n<h3>Input<\/h3>\nFirst line contains <b>T<\/b>, the number of test cases.\nEach of <b>T<\/b> lines contain 2 positive integers <b>N<\/b> and <b>K<\/b> separated by a space.\n<\/p><p>\n<h3>Output<\/h3>\nFor each test case, output the number of ways to conduct the game modulo 100000000000007 (10<sup>14<\/sup>+7) in one line.\n\n<h3>Example<\/h3>\n\n<pre>\n<b>Input:<\/b>\n3\n3 2\n4 0\n2 1\n\n<b>Output:<\/b>\n4\n0\n1\n<\/pre>\n\n\n\n<b>Explanation:<\/b>\n\nFor the 1st case, there are 3 players. Let's call them p1, p2, p3.\nDifferent games possible are:<br \/>\nGame 1: p1-p2 (numbers of bondings of p1, p2 are 1 \u2264 <b>K<\/b> = 2)<br \/>\nGame 2: p1-p3 (numbers of bondings of p1, p3 are 1 \u2264 <b>K<\/b> = 2)<br \/>\nGame 3: p2-p3 (numbers of bondings of p2, p3 are 1 \u2264 <b>K<\/b> = 2)<br \/>\nGame 4: p1-p2, p1-p3, p2-p3 (numbers of bondings of p1, p2, p3 are 2 \u2264 <b>K<\/b>\n= 2)\n\n\nFor the 2nd test case, we cannot form the game, because K = 0 and hence no\nplayer is allowed to make any bonding. As any game must have atleast one\nbonding, no game is possible here. \n\n\nFor the 3rd case, only possible game is:<br \/>\nGame 1: p1-p2 (number of bondings in p1, p2 are 1)\n\n\n<h3>Constraints<\/h3>\n1 \u2264 <b>T<\/b> \u2264 10000\n0 \u2264 <b>N<\/b> \u2264 10000\n0 \u2264 <b>K<\/b> \u2264 <b>N<\/b><\/p>","languages_supported":"ADA, ASM, BASH, BF, C, C99 strict, CAML, CLOJ, CLPS, CPP 4.3.2, CPP 4.9.2, CPP14, CS2, D, ERL, FORT, FS, GO, HASK, ICK, ICON, JAVA, JS, LISP clisp, LISP sbcl, LUA, NEM, NICE, NODEJS, PAS fpc, PAS gpc, PERL, PERL6, PHP, PIKE, PRLG, PYTH, PYTH 3.4, RUBY, SCALA, SCM guile, SCM qobi, ST, TCL, TEXT, WSPC","max_timelimit":"3","source_sizelimit":"50000","problem_author":"khadarbasha","problem_author_html_handle":"<span \n            class='rating' \n            style='display: inline-block; \n                    font-size: 10px; \n                    background: #666666;\n                    padding: 0 3px; \n                    line-height: 1.3; \n                    color: white;\n                    margin-right: 2px;'>1&#9733;<\/span><span>khadarbasha<\/span>","problem_tester":"laycurse","problem_tester_html_handle":"<span \n            class='rating' \n            style='display: inline-block; \n                    font-size: 10px; \n                    background: #FF7F00;\n                    padding: 0 3px; \n                    line-height: 1.3; \n                    color: white;\n                    margin-right: 2px;'>6&#9733;<\/span><span>laycurse<\/span>","date_added":"15-05-2012","tags":"<a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/aug12'>\n                    aug12\n                <\/a><a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/combinatorics'>\n                    combinatorics\n                <\/a><a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/khadarbasha'>\n                    khadarbasha\n                <\/a><a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/recurrence'>\n                    recurrence\n                <\/a>","editorial_url":"http:\/\/discuss.codechef.com\/problems\/MAXGAME","user":{"username":null},"time":{"view_start_date":1344676609,"submit_start_date":1344676609,"visible_start_date":1344677400,"end_date":1735669800,"current":1493557785},"todo":false,"problem_status":"unattempted"}

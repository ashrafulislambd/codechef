{"body":"\n<h3> All submissions for this problem are available. <\/h3><p>A chain is a series of connected links. David has been presented a chain for his birthday consisting of <b>N<\/b> links and would like to color each of the links into one of <b>M<\/b> colors. He would like the coloring to be pretty uniform, so that no color is used too often or too seldom. Finally, David came with the following restriction: he wants to color the links in such a way that every color is used at least once in every <b>M<\/b>+1 consecutive links.\n<br \/><br \/>\nTwo colorings are considered different if there exists at least one <b>i<\/b> between 1 and <b>N<\/b> such that link <b>i<\/b> is colored differently in these colorings. (The links are numbered, and the chain can not be rotated.) How many ways are there for David to color the chain?\n\n<h3>Input<\/h3>\n<\/p><p>The first line of the input file contains one integer <b>T<\/b> -- the number of test cases (no more than 10). Each of the next <b>T<\/b> lines contains two integers <b>N<\/b> and <b>M<\/b> -- the length of the chain presented to David and the number of colors (1 \u2264 <b>M<\/b> &lt; <b>N<\/b> \u2264 10<sup>5<\/sup>).\n\n<h3>Output<\/h3>\n<\/p><p>For each test case output the number of ways for David to color the chain modulo 1 000 000 007 (10<sup>9<\/sup> + 7).\n\n<h3>Example<\/h3>\n\n<pre>\n<b>Input:<\/b>\n3\n2 1\n4 2\n6 3\n\n<b>Output:<\/b>\n1\n10\n132\n<\/pre><\/p>    ","languages_supported":"NA","title":"COLCHAIN","category":"NA","old_version":true,"problem_code":"COLCHAIN"}

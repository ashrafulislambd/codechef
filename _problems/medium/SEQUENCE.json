To be precise, we say an integer is an n bit integer if it can be expressed in binary with exactly n bits (with, perhaps, some leading zeros). We say the sequence is <i>gradual<\/i> if two consecutive numbers differ in exactly one bit when written in binary and the first and last numbers also differ in exactly one bit in their binary representations.\n\n<\/p><p>\nYour job is to generate such a sequence. This is normally a fairly standard exercise, but there is one extra constraint. For some reason, there are two particular n bit numbers a and b such that it is illegal to have a and b appear consecutively (in either order) in the sequence and it is illegal to have one of a or b at the start of the sequence and the other at the end.\n\n<\/p><p>\nFor example, if n = 2, a = 1, and b = 3 then the sequence 0, 2, 3, 1 is not allowed since a and b are consecutive. The sequence 1, 0, 2, 3 is also not allowed since a is at the beginning and b is at the end. Finally, the sequence 0, 1, 2, 3 is also not allowed since two bits change when going from 1 to 2 and when going from 3 to 0.\n\n<h3>Input<\/h3>\n<\/p><p>The first line contains a single positive integer t \u2264 30 denoting the number of test cases to follow. Each test case consists of three numbers n, a, b. Here, n is the number of bits (between 1 and 15, inclusive) and a and b are distinct integers between 0 and 2<sup>n<\/sup>-1 (inclusive).\n\n<h3>Output<\/h3>\n<\/p><p>\nThe output for each test case is a single line consisting of a sequence of 2<sup>n<\/sup> integers. This should be such that the sequence is gradual according to the above description and contains all n bit integers. Furthermore, numbers a and b should not appear consecutively (in either order) nor does the start of the sequence contain one of a or b and the end contain the other. If there are many such sequences then any will do. On the other hand, if there is no such sequence then simply print a single line containing -1.\n\n<h3>Example<\/h3>\n\n<pre>\n<b>Input:<\/b>\n3\n2 0 1\n3 1 2\n3 5 7\n\n<b>Output:<\/b>\n-1\n0 1 3 2 6 7 5 4\n1 3 7 6 2 0 4 5\n\n<\/pre><\/p>    ","languages_supported":"NA","title":"SEQUENCE","category":"NA","old_version":true,"problem_code":"SEQUENCE"}

All submissions for this problem are available.\### Read problem statements in \[Hindi\](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME71/hindi/R2D2.pdf), \[Bengali\](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME71/bengali/R2D2.pdf), \[Mandarin Chinese\](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME71/mandarin/R2D2.pdf), \[Russian\](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME71/russian/R2D2.pdf), and \[Vietnamese\](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME71/vietnamese/R2D2.pdf) as well. The droid R2-D2 is travelling in space with a special mission. In space, there are $N$ planets (numbered $1$ through $N$) and $M$ bidirectional space highways. Each space highway connects two planets and in order to use it, R2-D2 needs to have a sufficiently high \*status level\*. The droid’s mission consists of $Q$ stages. In each stage, there are two planets $x$ and $y$ such that the droid should start the stage at planet $x$ with some initial status level $L$ ($L \\ge 0$) and travel to planet $y$. For each valid $i$, when R2-D2 is at planet $i$ (including the initial planet $x$), he may increase his status level by $A\_i$; it is not allowed to increase the status level multiple times on the same planet in the same stage. Find the minimum value of $L$ such that it is possible for R2-D2 to reach planet $y$ or determine that it is impossible to reach planet $y$ for any $L$. Note that the level R2-D2 has at the end of each stage is not carried over to the next stages (he may start the next stage with a lower initial status level). ### Input - The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows. - The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $M$. - The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $A\_1, A\_2, \\ldots, A\_N$. - Each of the following $M$ lines contains three space separated integers $U$, $V$ and $W$ denoting that there is a space highway between planets $U$ and $V$ and R2-D2 may use this highway only if his status level is at least $W$. - The next line contains a single integer $Q$. - The following $Q$ lines describe stages. Each of these lines contains two space-separated integers $x$ and $y$. ### Output For each stage, print a single line containing one integer ― the minimum status level required to complete the stage, or $-1$ if it is impossible to complete this stage. ### Constraints - $1 \\le T \\le 100$ - $1 \\le N, M, Q \\le 10^5$ - $0 \\le A\_i \\le 10^9$ for each valid $i$ - $0 \\le W \\le 10^9$ - $1 \\le U, V, x, y \\le N$ - the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $400,000$ - the sum of $M$ over all test cases does not exceed $400,000$ - the sum of $Q$ over all test cases does not exceed $400,000$ ### Subtasks \*\*Subtask #1 (12 points):\*\* - $N, Q \\le 1,000$ - $M \\le 1,200$ - the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $4,000$ - the sum of $M$ over all test cases does not exceed $4,000$ - the sum of $Q$ over all test cases does not exceed $4,000$ \*\*Subtask #2 (28 points):\*\* $A\_i = 0$ for each valid $i$ \*\*Subtask #3 (60 points):\*\* original constraints ### Example Input ``` 1 6 5 1 3 1 2 0 0 1 2 4 1 3 2 1 4 3 3 4 5 3 5 7 4 2 2 1 5 5 1 3 6 ``` ### Example Output ``` 0 1 7 -1 ``` ### Explanation In the second stage, R2-D2 can travel through planets $1 \\rightarrow 3 \\rightarrow 1 \\rightarrow 4 \\rightarrow 1 \\rightarrow 2 \\rightarrow 1 \\rightarrow 3 \\rightarrow 5$.

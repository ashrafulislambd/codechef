All submissions for this problem are available.\###Read problems statements \[Bengali\](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/COOK98/bengali/GHVSSI.pdf) and \[Vietnamese\](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/COOK98/vietnamese/GHVSSI.pdf) as well. Ghayeeth is a math teacher. He likes playing games, so he invented a new game which he wants to play against his student Siroj. The rules of the game are as follows: - Initially, Ghayeeth writes the numbers $A\_1, A\_2, \\dots, A\_N$ on a whiteboard and a number $Z=0$ on a piece of paper. - Ghayeeth and Siroj alternate turns; Ghayeeth goes first. - In each turn, the current player must pick a number that is currently written on the whiteboard, add it to $Z$ and erase it from the whiteboard. - After each turn, if there is no pair of positive integers $(a, b)$ such that $Z = a^2 - b^2$, then the last player who made a move loses the game. - Otherwise, if there are no more numbers on the whiteboard, the last player who made a move wins the game. Help Ghayeeth determine the winner of this game. ### Input - The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows. - The first line of each test case contains a single integer $N$. - The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $A\_1, A\_2, \\dots, A\_N$. ### Output For each test case, print a single line containing the string `"Ghayeeth"` or `"Siroj"` (without quotes) â€” the name of the winner. ### Constraints - $1 \\le T \\le 10$ - $1 \\le N \\le 300$ - $5 \\le A\_i \\le 100,000$ for each valid $i$ ### Example Input ``` 2 3 7 9 11 2 13 15 ``` ### Example Output ``` Ghayeeth Siroj ```

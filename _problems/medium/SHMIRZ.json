Formally , $i$-th shop sells $A[i]$ number of chocolates in exchange of $1$ coin . Also each shop will give $B[i]$ number of chocolates for free to any customer that buys chocolates from their shop .\n<br>\nChef likes chocolates very much so he regularly buys chocolates from any one shopkeeper who will give him maximum number of chocolates . <br\/>\nChef also likes playing with intervals . So each time Chef will have $x$ number of coins in his pocket and two integers $L$ and $R$ . Chef will look at every shop that lies between $L$ and $R$ and will buy chocolates from that shop which will give him maximum number of chocolates for $x$ coins .\n<br>\nAlso the position of shops are changing with time . \n<br> <br>\nMore formally there are $Q$ actions of two types that are happening in a sequence. <br>\n$1$ $i$ $j$                           $i$-th shop is shifted after $j$-th shop. <br>\n$2$ $L$ $R$ $x$                 Chef arrives at market to buy chocolates with $x$ coins in his pocket along with two integers $L$ and $R$ as described above.  <br> <br>\n\n<p> <b> Note that there are only $10$% queries of type $1$ .<\/b><\/p>\n<br><br>\n\n<h3>Input:<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>First line will contain $N$, number of shops.<\/li> \n <li>Next $N$ lines contains two space separated integers $A[i]$ and $B[i]$ as described above<\/li> \n<li>Next line contain one integer $Q$ number of queries. <\/li>\n<li>Next $Q$ line will contain queries of either of two types : $1)$ $1$ $i$ $j$   ,     $2)$  $2$ $L$ $R$ $x$ <br>\n<\/li>\n \n<\/ul>\n<h3>Output:<\/h3>\nPrint the answer for each query of type two in a new line. <br>\n\n<h3>Constraints<h3> \n<li>$1 \\leq N \\leq 50000$<\/li>\n<li> $1 \\leq A[i] ,B[i] \\leq 10^5$<\/li>\n<li> $1 \\leq Q \\leq 10^5$<\/li>\n<li> $1 \\leq i \\leq j \\leq N$<\/li>\n<li> $1 \\leq L \\leq R \\leq N$<\/li>\n<li> $1 \\leq x \\leq 10^5$<\/li>\n\n<h3>Sample Input:<\/h3>\n5     <br\/>\n2 2  <br\/>\n4 5<br\/>\n1 3<br\/>\n3 6<br\/>\n7 1<br\/>\n3<br\/>\n2 2 3 3<br\/>\n1 2 4<br\/>\n2 2 3 3<br\/>\n        \n<h3>Sample Output:<\/h3>\n17 <br\/>\n15 <br\/>\n\t\n<h3>EXPLANATION:<\/h3>\nBefore shifting shops in range $[2,3]$ are $(4,5) and (1,3)$ out of which $1$-st shop will give maximum chocolate i.e. $4*3+5=17$. <br>\nAfter shifting sequence of shop will be as below : <br>\n2 2  <br\/>\n1 3<br\/>\n3 6<br\/>\n4 5<br\/>\n7 1<br\/>\n Therefore  shops in range $[2,3]$ are $(1,3) and (3,6)$ out of which $2$-nd shop will give maximum chocolate i.e. $3*3+6=15$. <br>\n","languages_supported":"C, CPP14, JAVA, PYTH, PYTH 3.6, PYPY, CS2, PAS fpc, PAS gpc, RUBY, PHP, GO, NODEJS, HASK, rust, SCALA, swift, D, PERL, FORT, WSPC, ADA, CAML, ICK, BF, ASM, CLPS, PRLG, ICON, SCM qobi, PIKE, ST, NICE, LUA, BASH, NEM, LISP sbcl, LISP clisp, SCM guile, JS, ERL, TCL, kotlin, PERL6, TEXT, SCM chicken, PYP3, CLOJ, COB, FS","max_timelimit":"2.5","source_sizelimit":"50000","problem_author":"xodiac","problem_author_html_handle":"<span \n            class='rating' \n            style='display: inline-block; \n                    font-size: 10px; \n                    background: #FFBF00;\n                    padding: 0 3px; \n                    line-height: 1.3; \n                    color: white;\n                    margin-right: 2px;'>5&#9733;<\/span><span>xodiac<\/span>","problem_tester":null,"problem_tester_html_handle":"","date_added":"25-12-2018","tags":"<a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/convex-hull'>convex-hull<\/a>, <a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/decomposition'>decomposition<\/a>, <a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/medium-hard'>medium-hard<\/a>, <a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/pelt2019'>pelt2019<\/a>, <a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/squareroot'>squareroot<\/a>, <a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/xodiac'>xodiac<\/a>, <a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/xodiac'>xodiac<\/a>","time":{"view_start_date":1547476200,"submit_start_date":1547476200,"visible_start_date":1547476200,"end_date":1735669800,"current":1559472982},"user":{"username":"","access":"default"},"todo":false,"problem_status":"unattempted","is_direct_submittable":false}

All submissions for this problem are available.There are $N$ planets numbered $1$ to $N$. You are a space merchant who earns by selling goods on these planets. Traveling to each planet requires you to pay for the fuel. The difficulty of traveling to $i$-th planet is $D\_i$. You need to plan your trip by choosing a consecutive sub segment of planets. Your earning of the trip is calculated as follows - - You earn $A$ coins for every planet you visit. - For each planet $i$ you visit, you have to pay $C\_i$ coins for the fuel. - If you visit every planet with indices $L$ to $R$, you also have to pay $gap(L,R)$ coins where $gap(L,R) = max \[ (D\_r - D\_l)^2\]$ $for L

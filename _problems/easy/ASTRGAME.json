{"body":"\n<h3> All submissions for this problem are available. <\/h3><p>Teddy and Tracy like to play a game based on strings. The game is as follows. Initially, Tracy writes a long random string on a whiteboard. Then, each player starting with Teddy makes turn alternately. Each turn, the player must erase a contiguous substring that exists in the dictionary. The dictionary consists of <i>N<\/i> words.<\/p>\n\n<p>Of course, the player that can't erase any substring in his turn loses the game, and the other player is declared the winner.<\/p>\n\n<p>Note that after a substring R is erased, the remaining substring becomes separated, i.e. they cannot erase a word that occurs partially to the left of R and partially to the right of R.\n\n<\/p><p>Determine the winner of the game, assuming that both players play optimally.<\/p>\n\n<h3>Input<\/h3>\n<p>The first line contains a single integer <i>T<\/i>, the number of test cases. <i>T<\/i> test cases follow. The first line of each testcase contains a string <i>S<\/i>, the string Tracy writes on the whiteboard. The next line contains a single integer <i>N<\/i>. <i>N<\/i> lines follow. The <i>i<\/i>-th line contains a single string <i>w<sub>i<\/sub><\/i>, the <i>i<\/i>-th word in the dictionary.<\/p>\n\n<h3>Output<\/h3>\n<p>For each test case, output a single line containing the name of the winner of the game.<\/p>\n\n<h3>Example<\/h3>\n<pre>\n<b>Input:<\/b>\n3\ncodechef\n2\ncode\nchef\nfoo\n1\nbar\nmississippi\n4\nssissi\nmippi\nmi\nppi\n\n<b>Output:<\/b>\nTracy\nTracy\nTeddy\n<\/pre>\n\n<h3>Constraints<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>1 &lt;= <i>T<\/i> &lt;= 5<\/li>\n<li>1 &lt;= <i>N<\/i> &lt;= 30<\/li>\n<li>1 &lt;= |<i>S<\/i>| &lt;= 30<\/li>\n<li>1 &lt;= |<i>w<sub>i<\/sub><\/i>| &lt;= 30<\/li>\n<li><i>S<\/i> and <i>w<sub>i<\/sub><\/i> contain only characters 'a'-'z'<\/li>\n<\/ul>    ","languages_supported":"NA","title":"ASTRGAME","category":"NA","old_version":true,"problem_code":"ASTRGAME"}

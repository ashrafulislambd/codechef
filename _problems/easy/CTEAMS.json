{"body":"\n<h3> All submissions for this problem are available. <\/h3><p>The executive chef is trying to bring some competitive spirit into his kitchen. He wants to split the chefs into two teams based on their age - he'll form the young and the old team. To make it fair, he will split them evenly or give the young team one person advantage when there is an odd number of chefs. Ages of all employees are unique. The executive chef also rated all chefs according to their cooking skills. Rating of a team is equal to the sum of ratings of its members. The chefs have developed a habit of coming to work late.

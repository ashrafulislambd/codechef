{"body":"\n<h3> All submissions for this problem are available. <\/h3><p>Johnny needs to make a rectangular box for his physics class project. He has bought P cm of wire and S cm<sup>2<\/sup> of special paper. He would like to use all the wire (for the 12 edges) and paper (for the 6 sides) to make the box.<\/p>\n<p>What is the largest volume of the box that Johnny can make?<\/p>\n<h3>Input<\/h3>\n<p>The first line contains t, the number of test cases (about 10). Then t test cases follow.<\/p>\n<p>Each test case contains two integers P and S in a line (1 \u2264 P \u2264 40000, 1 \u2264 S \u2264 20000). You may assume that there always exists an optimal solution for the given input cases.<\/p>\n<h3>Output<\/h3>\n<p>For each test case, print a real number that is the largest volume of the box that Johnny can make, rounded to two decimal places.<\/p>\n<h3>Example<\/h3>\n<pre><b>Input:<\/b>\n2\n20 14\n20 16\n\n<b>Output:<\/b>\n3.00\n4.15\n\n<b>Output details<\/b>\nFirst case: the dimensions of the largest box may be 3, 1 and 1.\nSecond case: the dimensions of the largest box may be 7\/3, 4\/3 and 4\/3.\n<\/pre>    ","languages_supported":"NA","title":"J7","category":"NA","old_version":true,"problem_code":"J7"}

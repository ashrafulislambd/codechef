Chef's chessboard does not have to be a correct chessboard (in particular, it may have $N \\neq M$).\n\nA *sub-board* of Chef's chessboard is a rectangular piece of this board with an arbitrarily chosen top left and bottom right cell (possibly equal to the original chessboard). Every sub-board is also a chessboard.\n\nChef can invert some cells; inverting a cell means changing its color from white to black or from black to white. After inverting those cells, he wants to cut the maximum correct sub-board out of the original chessboard.\n\nChef has not yet decided how many cells he would like to invert. Now he wonders about the answers to $Q$ question. In the $i$-th question ($1 \\le i \\le Q$), he is allowed to invert at most $c_i$ cells (possibly zero); he would like to know the side length of the largest possible correct sub-board of his chessboard. Help Chef answer these questions.\n\n### Input\n- The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $M$.\n- $N$ lines follow. For each valid $i$, the $i$-th of these lines contains a string with length $M$ describing the $i$-th row of Chef's chessboard. Each character of this string is either '0', representing a black cell, or '1', representing a white cell.\n- The next line contains a single integer $Q$.\n- The last line contains $Q$ space-separated integers $c_1, c_2, \\dots, c_Q$.\n\n### Output\nFor each question, print a single line containing one integer \u2014 the maximum size of a correct sub-board.\n\n### Constraints \n- $1 \\le N, M \\le 200$\n- $1 \\le Q \\le 10^5$\n- $0 \\le c_i \\le 10^9$ for each valid $i$\n\n### Subtasks\n**Subtask #1 (20 points):**\n- $1 \\le N, M \\le 20$\n- $1 \\le Q \\le 100$\n\n**Subtask #2 (30 points):** $1 \\le N, M \\le 20$\n\n**Subtask #3 (50 points):** original constraints\n\n### Example Input\n```\n8 8\n00101010\n00010101\n10101010\n01010101\n10101010\n01010101\n10101010\n01010101\n4\n1 2 0 1001\n```\n\n### Example Output\n```\n7\n8\n6\n8\n```\n\n### Explanation\nIf we don't change the board, the best answer here is the 6x6 bottom right sub-board. We can invert cells $(2, 2)$ and $(1, 1)$ to get a better answer.\n","languages_supported":"C, CPP14, JAVA, PYTH, PYTH 3.6, PYPY, CS2, PAS fpc, PAS gpc, RUBY, PHP, GO, NODEJS, HASK, rust, SCALA, swift, D, PERL, FORT, WSPC, ADA, CAML, ICK, BF, ASM, CLPS, PRLG, ICON, SCM qobi, PIKE, ST, NICE, LUA, BASH, NEM, LISP sbcl, LISP clisp, SCM guile, JS, ERL, TCL, kotlin, PERL6, TEXT, SCM chicken, PYP3, CLOJ, COB, FS","max_timelimit":"1","source_sizelimit":"50000","problem_author":"izaron","problem_author_html_handle":"<span \n            class='rating' \n            style='display: inline-block; \n                    font-size: 10px; \n                    background: #3366CC;\n                    padding: 0 3px; \n                    line-height: 1.3; \n                    color: white;\n                    margin-right: 2px;'>3&#9733;<\/span><span>izaron<\/span>","problem_tester":null,"problem_tester_html_handle":"","date_added":"16-09-2018","tags":"<a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/easy-medium'>easy-medium<\/a>, <a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/izaron'>izaron<\/a>, <a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/oct18'>oct18<\/a>, <a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/prefix-sum'>prefix-sum<\/a>","editorial_url":"https:\/\/discuss.codechef.com\/problems\/SURCHESS","time":{"view_start_date":1540027803,"submit_start_date":1540027803,"visible_start_date":1540027803,"end_date":1735669800,"current":1559472962},"user":{"username":"","access":"default"},"todo":false,"problem_status":"unattempted","is_direct_submittable":false}

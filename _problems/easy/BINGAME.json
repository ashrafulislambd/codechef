Both the players takes turns alternatively, and $P_1$ goes first. Rules of the game are as follows.\n\n- In $P_1$\u2019s turn, he should choose any element $A_i$ which is $\\ge 1$, and subtract $1$ from it.\n- In $P_2$\u2019s turn, he should choose any element $A_i$ which is $\\ge 2$, and subtract $2$ from it.\n- The player who is not able to make a move loses.\nGiven the array $A$, find the number of different indices $i$ such that that $P_1$ can subtract from $A_i$ in his first turn, and end up winning the game, if both the players play optimally after this.\n\n### Input\n- The first line of the input contains an integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.\n- The first line of each test case contains an integer $n$.\n- The second line of each test case contains $n$ space-separated integers denoting the array $A$.\n\n### Output\nFor each test case, output an integer corresponding to the number of possible first moves of $P_1$ that lead him to win.\n\n###Constraints\n- $1 \\le T \\le 10^5$\n- $1 \\le n \\leq  10^5$\n- $1 \\le A_i \\leq 10^5$\n- Sum of $n$ over all the test cases doesn't exceed $10^6$\n\n### Example Input\n```\n3\n1\n1\n1\n3\n2\n1 2\n```\n\n### Example Output\n```\n1\n0\n1\n```\n\n###Explanation\n**Testcase 1**: The array is {1}. $P_1$ has no choice but to pick the element and subtract 1 from it. The resulting array is {0}, and now $P_2$ is unable to make a move. Hence $P_1$ wins, and there was only one winning first move. Hence the answer is 1.\n\n**Testcase 2**: The array is {3}. $P_1$ has no choice but to pick the element and subtract 1 from it. The resulting array is {2}, and now $P_2$ has no choice but to subtract 2 from it. The resulting array is {0}, and now $P_1$ is unable to make a move. Hence $P_1$ loses.There is no starting move for $P_1$ which leads to his victory. Hence the answer is 0.\n\n**Testcase 3**: The array is {1, 2}. $P_1$ has two choices. Either subtract 1 from 1 or subtract 1 from 2. \n- Suppose he subtracts 1 from the first element, then the resulting array is {0, 2}, and now $P_2$ has no choice but to subtract 2 from the second element. The resulting array is {0, 0}, and now $P_1$ is unable to make a move. Hence $P_1$ loses in this case.\n- But suppose he subtracts 1 from the second element, then the resulting array is {1, 1}, and now $P_2$ is unable to make a move. Hence $P_1$ wins in this case.\n\nThus, there is exactly one starting move for $P_1$ which leads to his victory. Hence the answer is 1.","languages_supported":"C, CPP14, JAVA, PYTH, PYTH 3.6, PYPY, CS2, PAS fpc, PAS gpc, RUBY, PHP, GO, NODEJS, HASK, rust, SCALA, swift, D, PERL, FORT, WSPC, ADA, CAML, ICK, BF, ASM, CLPS, PRLG, ICON, SCM qobi, PIKE, ST, NICE, LUA, BASH, NEM, LISP sbcl, LISP clisp, SCM guile, JS, ERL, TCL, kotlin, PERL6, TEXT, SCM chicken, PYP3, CLOJ, COB, FS","max_timelimit":"2","source_sizelimit":"50000","problem_author":"admin2","problem_author_html_handle":"admin2","problem_tester":null,"problem_tester_html_handle":"","date_added":"13-12-2018","tags":"<a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/admin2'>admin2<\/a>","time":{"view_start_date":1544985000,"submit_start_date":1544985000,"visible_start_date":1544985000,"end_date":1735669800,"current":1559472936},"user":{"username":"","access":"default"},"todo":false,"problem_status":"unattempted","is_direct_submittable":false}

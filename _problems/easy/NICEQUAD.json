{"body":"\n<h3> All submissions for this problem are available. <\/h3><p>There are n points with integer coordinates. We can form different quadrangles out of them by taking four different points and connecting them with lines. Let   s call a quadrangle ABCD nice if and only if:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ax &gt; 0 and Ay &gt; 0;<\/li>\n<li>Bx &gt; 0 and By &lt; 0;<\/li>\n<li>Cx &lt; 0 and Cy &lt; 0;<\/li>\n<li>Dx &lt; 0 and Dy &gt; 0;<\/li>\n<li>ABCD has an integer area.<\/li>\n<\/ul><br \/>\n<p>Your task is to count all different nice quadrangles that can be formed on the given points.<\/p>\n\n<h3>Input<\/h3>\n<p>The first line of input file contains number t     the number of test cases. Then the description of each test case follows. The first line of each test case contains number n     the number of points. Then n lines follow each consisting of two integers x, y     the coordinates of a point. No two points in the same test case coincide.\n\n<h3>Constraints<\/h3>\n<\/p><p>1 &lt;= t &lt;= 10<br \/>\n1 &lt;= n &lt;= 30000<br \/>\n-30000 &lt;= x, y &lt;= 30000\n\n<h3>Output<\/h3>\n<\/p><p>For each test case print the number of nice quadrangles that can be formed using given points.\n\n<h3>Example<\/h3>\n\n<pre>\n<b>Input:<\/b>\n1\n6\n1 1\n2 2\n-1 -1\n-2 2\n2 -1\n-3 -4\n\n<b>Output:<\/b>\n2\n\n<\/pre><\/p>    ","languages_supported":"NA","title":"NICEQUAD","category":"NA","old_version":true,"problem_code":"NICEQUAD"}

{"body":"\n<h3> All submissions for this problem are available. <\/h3>\n<p>You are given a set of points in the 2D plane. You start at the point with the least X and greatest Y value, and end at the point with the greatest X and least Y value. The rule for movement is that you can not move to a point with a lesser X value as compared to the X value of the point you are on. Also for points having the same X value, you need to visit the point with the greatest Y value before visiting the next point with the same X value. So, if there are 2 points: (0,4 and 4,0) we would start with (0,4) - i.e. least X takes precedence over greatest Y. You need to visit every point in the plane.<\/p>\n<h3>Input<\/h3>\n<p>You will be given an integer t(1&lt;=t&lt;=20) representing the number of test cases. A new line follows; after which the t test cases are given. Each test case starts with a blank line followed by an integer n(2&lt;=n&lt;=100000), which represents the number of points to follow. This is followed by a new line. Then follow the n points, each being a pair of integers separated by a single space; followed by a new line. The X and Y coordinates of each point will be between 0 and 10000 both inclusive.<\/p>\n<h3>Output<\/h3>\n<p>For each test case, print the total distance traveled by you from start to finish; keeping in mind the rules mentioned above, correct to 2 decimal places. The result for each test case must be on a new line.<\/p>\n<h3>Example<\/h3>\n<pre>\n<b>Input:<\/b>\n3\n\n2\n0 0\n0 1\n\n3\n0 0\n1 1\n2 2\n\n4\n0 0\n1 10\n1 5\n2 2\n\n<b>Output:<\/b>\n1.00\n2.83\n18.21\n\nFor the third test case above, the following is the path you must take:\n0,0 -> 1,10  \n1,10 -> 1,5\n1,5 -> 2,2\n= 18.21\n<\/pre>    ","languages_supported":"NA","title":"POINTS","category":"NA","old_version":true,"problem_code":"POINTS"}

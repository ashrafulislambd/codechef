All submissions for this problem are available.Petya is preparing a problem for a local contest in his school. The problem is to find a longest increasing subsequence in a given permutation. A \*permutation\* of size $n$ is a sequence of $n$ numbers $a\_1, \\ldots, a\_n$ such that every number from $1$ to $n$ occurs in the sequence exactly once. An \*increasing subsequence\* of length $k$ of the sequence $a\_1, \\ldots, a\_n$ is a sequence of indices $i\_1, \\ldots, i\_k$ such that $1 \\leq i\_1

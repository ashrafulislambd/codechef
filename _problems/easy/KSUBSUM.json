{"body":"\n<h3> All submissions for this problem are available. <\/h3><p align=\"justify\">\nDid you know that the Hindus believe there are 330 million deities ? Lets discuss about them in long contests. The three main forces of god Brahma, Vishnu and Mahesh, also called Trimurti ( 3 forms ), want to decide when to end the world. Given an array A, which contains the 'Good' ( or 'Evil' ) score of each place on earth, they can easily find the maximum sum of the scores of a (contiguous) sub-array of places. But this is not much useful to them. So, <i>each<\/i> of them gives a value K and want to know the Kth maximum sum of scores of a contiguous sub-array. In other words, find the value of S[K] (1-based index), where the array S contains the sums of all possible contiguous sub-arrays in non-increasing order.\n\n<h3>Input<\/h3>\n<\/p><p align=\"justify\">\nFirst line contains T, number of test cases. T cases follow. In each test case, first line contains N K1 K2 K3. Next line contains N space separated integers.\n<br \/>\n\n\n<h3>Output<\/h3>\n<\/p><p align=\"justify\">\nFor each test case, output the K1<sup>th<\/sup>, K2<sup>th<\/sup> and K3<sup>th<\/sup> maximum sum in a single line, separated by a single space. See sample cases and explanation for more clarity.\n\n<h3>Constraints<\/h3>\n<\/p><p align=\"justify\">\n1 \u2264 T \u2264 3<br \/>\n2 \u2264 N \u2264 10000<br \/>\n1 \u2264 K1 &lt; K2 &lt; K3 \u2264 2012<br \/>\nK3 \u2264 N*(N+1)\/2<br \/>\n-10000 \u2264 A[i] \u2264 10000<br \/>\n\n\n<h3>Example<\/h3>\n\n<pre>\n<b>Input:<\/b>\n3\n3 1 2 3\n10 20 30\n3 3 4 6\n10 20 30\n4 2 6 10\n20 -15 10 -15\n\n<b>Output:<\/b>\n60 50 30\n30 30 10\n15 -5 -20\n<\/pre>\n<br \/>\n<b>Explanation:<\/b><br \/>\nCase 1 &amp; 2 : A = { 10, 20, 30 }.

{"body":"\n<h3> All submissions for this problem are available. <\/h3><p>You are given a chessboard of size NxN. There is a white knight and several black pawns located on the board. The knight can move similarly to the normal knight in the game of chess; however it can only move towards the right of the board (see the below figure).<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/vn.spoj.pl\/SPOJVN\/content\/whitekn.png\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The mission of the knight is to capture as many black pawns as possible. Its journey ends when it moves to the rightmost column of the board.<\/p>\n<p>Compute the maximum number of black pawns the white knight can capture.<\/p>\n<h3>Input<\/h3>\n<p>The first line contains t, the number of test cases (about 10). Then t test cases follow.<\/p>\n<p>Each test case has the following form:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The first line contains N, the size of the chessboard (4 \u2264 N \u2264 1000).<\/li>\n<li>Then N lines follow, each line containing N characters which may be '0', 'K' or 'P', corresponding to the empty cell, the white knight, and the black pawn, respectively.

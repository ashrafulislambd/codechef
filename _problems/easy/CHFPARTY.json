However, they have certain conditions \u2014 for each valid $i$, when the $i$-th friend arrives at the party and sees that at that point, strictly less than $A_i$ other people (excluding Chef) have joined the party, this friend leaves the party; otherwise, this friend joins the party.\n\nHelp Chef estimate how successful the party can be \u2014 find the maximum number of his friends who could join the party (for an optimal choice of the order of arrivals).\n\n### Input\n- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.\n- The first line of each test case contains a single integer $N$.\n- The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_N$.\n\n### Output\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \u2014 the maximum number of Chef's friends who could join the party.\n\n### Constraints\n- $1 \\le T \\le 1,000$\n- $1 \\le N \\le 10^5$\n- the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^6$\n\n### Example Input\n```\n3\n2\n0 0\n6\n3 1 0 0 5 5\n3\n1 2 3\n```\n\n### Example Output\n```\n2\n4\n0\n```\n\n### Explanation\n**Example case 1:** Chef has two friends. Both of them do not require anyone else to be at the party before they join, so they will both definitely join the party.\n \n**Example case 2:** At the beginning, friends $3$ and $4$ can arrive and join the party, since they do not require anyone else to be at the party before they join. After that, friend $2$ can arrive; this friend would see that there are two people at the party and therefore also join. Then, friend $1$ will also join, so in the end, there would be $4$ people attending the party.\n\n**Example case 3:** No one will attend the party because each of Chef's friends will find zero people at the party and leave, regardless of the order in which they arrive.\n","languages_supported":"C, CPP14, JAVA, PYTH, PYTH 3.6, PYPY, CS2, PAS fpc, PAS gpc, RUBY, PHP, GO, NODEJS, HASK, rust, SCALA, swift, D, PERL, FORT, WSPC, ADA, CAML, ICK, BF, ASM, CLPS, PRLG, ICON, SCM qobi, PIKE, ST, NICE, LUA, BASH, NEM, LISP sbcl, LISP clisp, SCM guile, JS, ERL, TCL, kotlin, PERL6, TEXT, SCM chicken, PYP3, CLOJ, COB, FS","max_timelimit":"1","source_sizelimit":"50000","problem_author":"kingofnumbers","problem_author_html_handle":"<span \n            class='rating' \n            style='display: inline-block; \n                    font-size: 10px; \n                    background: #FF7F00;\n                    padding: 0 3px; \n                    line-height: 1.3; \n                    color: white;\n                    margin-right: 2px;'>6&#9733;<\/span><span>kingofnumbers<\/span>","problem_tester":null,"problem_tester_html_handle":"","date_added":"17-02-2019","tags":"<a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/chefparty'>chefparty<\/a>, <a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/cook103'>cook103<\/a>, <a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/easy'>easy<\/a>, <a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/kingofnumbers'>kingofnumbers<\/a>, <a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/sorting'>sorting<\/a>","editorial_url":"https:\/\/discuss.codechef.com\/problems\/CHFPARTY","time":{"view_start_date":1550428202,"submit_start_date":1550428202,"visible_start_date":1550428202,"end_date":1735669800,"current":1559472939},"user":{"username":"","access":"default"},"todo":false,"problem_status":"unattempted","is_direct_submittable":false}

They have set on a new space mission, where they have to destroy $2$ galaxies ruled by Discordiana and Hypnotos (siblings of Thanos).The galaxies initially have $D$ and $H$ number of planets. You are now a guardian and Rocket has ordered you to destroy all the planets in both of the evil galaxies, but he allows you only two guns-       \n - one destroys exactly one planet from both the galaxies simultaneously (can be done only if possible)\n- the other cuts in half each planet from one galaxy of your choice and in effect doubles the number of planets. \n\nYou have to find whether it\u2019s possible to destroy both the galaxies, and if yes, the minimum number of gun firings required. \n\n###Input:\n\n- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.\n- Each testcase contains of a single line of input, two integers $D, H$.\n\n###Output:\nFor each testcase, output a single integer denoting the minimum number of gun firings required. Print $-1$ if not possible. \n\n###Constraints\n- $1 \\leq T \\leq 50$\n- $0 \\leq D, H \\leq 10^5$\n\n###Sample Input:\n2       \n2 9     \n13 14\n\n###Sample Output:\n12   \n15\n    \n###EXPLANATION:\nThe following sequence of pair of $(D,H)$ will give:-        \n(2,9)->(1,8)->(2,8)->(4,8)->(8,8)->(7,7)->(6,6)->(5,5)->(4,4)->(3,3)->(2,2)->(1,1)->(0,0)\n","languages_supported":"C, CPP14, JAVA, PYTH, PYTH 3.6, PYPY, CS2, PAS fpc, PAS gpc, RUBY, PHP, GO, NODEJS, HASK, rust, SCALA, swift, D, PERL, FORT, WSPC, ADA, CAML, ICK, BF, ASM, CLPS, PRLG, ICON, SCM qobi, PIKE, ST, NICE, LUA, BASH, NEM, LISP sbcl, LISP clisp, SCM guile, JS, ERL, TCL, kotlin, PERL6, TEXT, SCM chicken, PYP3, CLOJ, R, COB, FS","max_timelimit":"1","source_sizelimit":"50000","problem_author":"la_flame_","problem_author_html_handle":"<span \n            class='rating' \n            style='display: inline-block; \n                    font-size: 10px; \n                    background: #FFBF00;\n                    padding: 0 3px; \n                    line-height: 1.3; \n                    color: white;\n                    margin-right: 2px;'>5&#9733;<\/span><span>la_flame_<\/span>","problem_tester":null,"problem_tester_html_handle":"","date_added":"27-03-2019","tags":"<a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/la_flame_'>la_flame_<\/a>","time":{"view_start_date":1553792400,"submit_start_date":1553792400,"visible_start_date":1553792400,"end_date":1735669800,"current":1559472948},"user":{"username":"","access":"default"},"todo":false,"problem_status":"unattempted","is_direct_submittable":false}

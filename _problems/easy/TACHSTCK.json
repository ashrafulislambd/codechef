Originated in ancient China, they can also be found in some areas of Tibet and Nepal that are close to Han Chinese populations, as well as areas of Thailand, Laos and Burma which have significant Chinese populations. Chopsticks are most commonly made of wood, bamboo or plastic, but in China, most are made out of bamboo. Chopsticks are held in the dominant hand, between the thumb and fingers, and used to pick up pieces of food.]<\/p>\n<p><\/p><\/i><\/p>\n<p align=\"right\"> Retrieved from <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Chopsticks\">wikipedia<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Actually, the two sticks in a pair of chopsticks need not be of the same length.

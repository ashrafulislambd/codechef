There are $N$ rebel soldiers and they are represented by the numbers $Rebel_1, Rebel_2, \\ldots, Rebel_N$. The king has deployed his soldiers in a long defensive wall, and this is represented by two integers: $lower$ and $upper$. This means that the King's army contains ($upper$ - $lower$ +1) soldiers represented by all the numbers between $lower$ and $upper$ (end points inclusive). \n\nThe rebels pick individual soldiers from the King's army and ambush them one by one. A soldier $x$ in the King's army will be defeated only if all the $N$ numbers $Rebel_1, Rebel_2, \\ldots,$ and $Rebel_N$ divide $x$ without leaving a remainder. Else, $x$ will survive.\n\nYour job is to count the number of soldiers in the King's army who will survive at the end,\n\n###Input:\n\n- First line will contain $T$, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. \n- The first line of each test case will contain $N$, representing the number of soldiers in the rebel army.\n- The second line of each testcase contains  $N$ spaced integers: $Rebel_1, Rebel_2, \\ldots, Rebel_N$.\n- The third line of each testcase contains the 2 integers representing the range $[lower,  upper]$ of the King's army.\n\n###Output:\nFor each test case, output the answer in a single line.\n\n###Constraints \n- $1 \\leq T \\leq 1000$\n- $1 \\leq N \\leq 500$\n- $1 \\leq Rebel_i \\leq 10^9$\n- $1 \\leq lower \\leq upper \\leq 10^{18}$\n\n###Sample Input:\n```\n1\n2\n2 4\n4 8\n```\n\n###Sample Output:\n```\n3\n```\n\t\n###EXPLANATION:\nThe rebels' army contains the soldiers {$2,4$}. The King's army contains the soldiers {$4,5,6,7,8$}.\n\nThe rebels will be able to kill {$4,8$} in the King's army as all the members of rebel army can divide {$4,8$} without leaving a remainder. The other three soldiers, {$5,6,7$} will survive, and hence the answer is 3.","languages_supported":"C, CPP14, JAVA, PYTH, PYTH 3.6, PYPY, CS2, PAS fpc, PAS gpc, RUBY, PHP, GO, NODEJS, HASK, rust, SCALA, swift, D, PERL, FORT, WSPC, ADA, CAML, ICK, BF, ASM, CLPS, PRLG, ICON, SCM qobi, PIKE, ST, NICE, LUA, BASH, NEM, LISP sbcl, LISP clisp, SCM guile, JS, ERL, TCL, kotlin, PERL6, TEXT, SCM chicken, PYP3, CLOJ, COB, FS","max_timelimit":"1","source_sizelimit":"50000","problem_author":"bipin2","problem_author_html_handle":"<span \n            class='rating' \n            style='display: inline-block; \n                    font-size: 10px; \n                    background: #3366CC;\n                    padding: 0 3px; \n                    line-height: 1.3; \n                    color: white;\n                    margin-right: 2px;'>3&#9733;<\/span><span>bipin2<\/span>","problem_tester":null,"problem_tester_html_handle":"","date_added":"20-12-2018","tags":"<a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/bipin2'>bipin2<\/a>","time":{"view_start_date":1546074900,"submit_start_date":1546074900,"visible_start_date":1546074900,"end_date":1735669800,"current":1559472934},"user":{"username":"","access":"default"},"todo":false,"problem_status":"unattempted","is_direct_submittable":false}

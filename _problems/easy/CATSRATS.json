Each cat and each rat wants to move from some point to some (possibly the same) point on this line. Naturally, the cats also want to eat the rats when they get a chance. Both the cats and the rats can only move with constant speed $1$.\n\nFor each valid $i$, the $i$-th cat is initially sleeping at a point $a_i$. At a time $s_i$, this cat wakes up and starts moving to a final point $b_i$ with constant velocity and without any detours (so it arrives at this point at the time $e_i = s_i + |a_i-b_i|$). After it arrives at the point $b_i$, it falls asleep again.\n\nFor each valid $i$, the $i$-th rat is initially hiding at a point $c_i$. At a time $r_i$, this rat stops hiding and starts moving to a final point $d_i$ in the same way as the cats \u2015 with constant velocity and without any detours, arriving at the time $q_i = r_i + |c_i-d_i|$ (if it does not get eaten). After it arrives at the point $d_i$, it hides again.\n\nIf a cat and a rat meet each other (they are located at the same point at the same time), the cat eats the rat, the rat disappears and cannot be eaten by any other cat. A sleeping cat cannot eat a rat and a hidden rat cannot be eaten \u2015 formally, cat $i$ can eat rat $j$ only if they meet at a time $t$ satisfying $s_i \\le t \\le e_i$ and $r_j \\le t \\le q_j$.\n\nYour task is to find out which rats get eaten by which cats. It is guaranteed that no two cats will meet a rat at the same time.\n\n### Input\n- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.\n- The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $M$.\n- $N$ lines follow. For each $i$ ($1 \\le i \\le N$), the $i$-th of these lines contains three space-separated integers $a_i$, $b_i$ and $s_i$.\n- $M$ more lines follow. For each $i$ ($1 \\le i \\le M$), the $i$-th of these lines contains three space-separated integers $c_i$, $d_i$ and $r_i$.\n\n### Output\nFor each test case, print $M$ lines. For each valid $i$, the $i$-th of these lines should contain a single integer \u2015 the number of the cat that will eat the $i$-th rat, or $-1$ if no cat will eat this rat.\n\n### Constraints\n- $1 \\le T \\le 10$\n- $0 \\le N \\le 1,000$\n- $1 \\le M \\le 1,000$\n- $1 \\le a_i, b_i, s_i \\le 10^9$ for each valid $i$\n- $1 \\le c_i, d_i, r_i \\le 10^9$ for each valid $i$\n- all initial and final positions of all cats and rats are pairwise distinct\n\n### Example Input\n```\n2\n8 7\n2 5 1\n1 4 1\n9 14 10\n20 7 9\n102 99 1\n199 202 1\n302 299 3\n399 402 3\n6 3 1\n10 15 10\n100 101 1\n201 200 1\n300 301 5\n401 400 5\n1000 1010 1020\n8 8\n2 8 2\n12 18 2\n22 28 4\n32 38 4\n48 42 2\n58 52 3\n68 62 1\n78 72 3\n3 6 3\n13 19 3\n21 25 3\n31 39 3\n46 43 4\n59 53 2\n65 61 4\n79 71 2\n```\n\n### Example Output\n```\n1\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n-1\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n```\n","languages_supported":"C, CPP14, JAVA, PYTH, PYTH 3.6, PYPY, CS2, PAS fpc, PAS gpc, RUBY, PHP, GO, NODEJS, HASK, rust, SCALA, swift, D, PERL, FORT, WSPC, ADA, CAML, ICK, BF, ASM, CLPS, PRLG, ICON, SCM qobi, PIKE, ST, NICE, LUA, BASH, NEM, LISP sbcl, LISP clisp, SCM guile, JS, ERL, TCL, kotlin, PERL6, TEXT, SCM chicken, PYP3, CLOJ, R, COB, FS","max_timelimit":"1","source_sizelimit":"50000","problem_author":"erfaniaa","problem_author_html_handle":"<span \n            class='rating' \n            style='display: inline-block; \n                    font-size: 10px; \n                    background: #684273;\n                    padding: 0 3px; \n                    line-height: 1.3; \n                    color: white;\n                    margin-right: 2px;'>4&#9733;<\/span><span>erfaniaa<\/span>","problem_tester":null,"problem_tester_html_handle":"","date_added":"16-03-2019","tags":"<a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/cook104'>cook104<\/a>, <a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/easy'>easy<\/a>, <a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/erfaniaa'>erfaniaa<\/a>","editorial_url":"https:\/\/discuss.codechef.com\/problems\/CATSRATS","time":{"view_start_date":1553452200,"submit_start_date":1553452200,"visible_start_date":1553452200,"end_date":1735669800,"current":1559472937},"user":{"username":"","access":"default"},"todo":false,"problem_status":"unattempted","is_direct_submittable":false}

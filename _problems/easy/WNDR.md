Nadaca is a country with $N$ cities. These cities are numbered $1$ through $N$ and connected by $M$ bidirectional roads. Each city can be reached from every other city using these roads. Initially, Ryan is in city $1$. At each of the following $K$ seconds, he may move from his current city to an adjacent city (a city connected by a road to his current city) or stay at his current city. Ryan also has $Q$ conditions $(a\_1, b\_1), (a\_2, b\_2), \\ldots, (a\_Q, b\_Q)$ meaning that during this $K$-second trip, for each valid $i$, he wants to be in city $a\_i$ after exactly $b\_i$ seconds. Since you are very good with directions, Ryan asked you to tell him how many different trips he could make while satisfying all conditions. Compute this number modulo $10^9 + 7$. A trip is a sequence of Ryan's current cities after $1, 2, \\ldots, K$ seconds. ### Input - The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows. - The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers $N$, $M$ and $K$. - Each of the next $M$ lines contains two space-separated integers $u$ and $v$ denoting a road between cities $u$ and $v$. - The next line contains a single integer $Q$. - $Q$ lines follow. For each $i$ ($1 \\le i \\le Q$), the $i$-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers $a\_i$ and $b\_i$. ### Output For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€” the number of trips Ryan can make, modulo $10^9+7$. ### Constraints - $1 \\le T \\le 50$ - $1 \\le N, M, K, Q \\le 9,000$ - $1 \\le u\_i, v\_i \\le N$ for each valid $i$ - $u\_i \\neq v\_i$ for each valid $i$ - there is at most one road between each pair of cities - each city is reachable from every other city - $1 \\le a\_i \\le N$ for each valid $i$ - $0 \\le b\_i \\le K$ for each valid $i$ - the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $9,000$ - the sum of $K$ over all test cases does not exceed $9,000$ - the sum of $M$ over all test cases does not exceed $9,000$ - the sum of $Q$ over all test cases does not exceed $9,000$ ### Subtasks \*\*Subtask #1 (20 points):\*\* - the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $400$ - the sum of $K$ over all test cases does not exceed $400$ - the sum of $M$ over all test cases does not exceed $400$ - the sum of $Q$ over all test cases does not exceed $400$ \*\*Subtask #2 (80 points):\*\* original constraints ### Example Input ``` 3 4 3 3 1 2 1 3 1 4 0 4 3 3 1 2 1 3 1 4 1 2 2 4 3 3 1 2 1 3 1 4 1 2 1 ``` ### Example Output ``` 28 4 6 ```

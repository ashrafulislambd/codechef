The other $N-K$ elements remain untouched. \n\nCan you help him to find the minimum value of $K$ for which this is possible? \n\n###Input:\n\n- The first line of the input contains two space separated integer $N$ and $M$\n- The second line contains N space-separated integers which denotes the type of items he has bought as \n  $A_1$, $A_2$, . . . . . $A_N$ . \n\n###Output:\n\nPrint a single line containing one integer \u2014  minimum value of $K$ for which items of same type occurs continuously. \n\n###Constraints \n- $1 \\leq N \\leq 100000$\n- $1 \\leq M \\leq 20$\n- $1 \\leq A_i \\leq M$\n\n###Sample Input:\n\t6 3\n\t1 2 3 1 2 3\n\n###Sample Output:\n\t3\n\t\n###EXPLANATION:\nOne of the possible way is to select the items at indexes $1st$ , $3rd$ and $5th$.\nWe can permute the selected items by placing the $1st$ ,$3rd$ and $5th$ items at $3rd$ ,$5th$ and $1st$ places respectively to finally get 2 2 1 1 3 3.

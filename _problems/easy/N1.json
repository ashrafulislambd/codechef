{"body":"\n<h3> All submissions for this problem are available. <\/h3><p>Treasure Hunting is a great computer game that has attracted generations of Bytelandian children.\n<\/p><p>In the game, there is a maze divided into NxN squares. Dave starts in the top-left corner, which is square (1,1), and needs to go to the bottom-right corner, which is square (n,n).\n<\/p><p>Some of the squares are blocked and some of the squares contain treasures.\n<\/p><p>Dave needs to capture all the treasures in the maze before going to square (n,n).\n<\/p><p>In each second, Dave can go to one of its four adjacent squares (if the destination is not blocked). \n<\/p><p>Find the earliest time that Dave can reach the destination(n,n) after collecting all the treasures in the maze.\n\n<h3>Input<\/h3>\n<\/p><p>The first line contains t, the number of test cases (about 15). Then t test cases follow. Each test case has the following form.\n<\/p><p>The first line contains N (1 &lt;= N &lt;= 13), the size of the maze\n<\/p><p>The N following lines describe the maze. The meaning of the symbols is as follows:\n<\/p><p>'.' : an empty square\n<\/p><p>'*' : a treasure\n<\/p><p>'#' : a blocked square\n<\/p><p>The number of treasures in the maze does not exceed 13. Squares (1,1) and (n,n) are always empty.\n<\/p><p>Each test case's input is separated by a blank line.\n\n<h3>Output<\/h3>\n<\/p><p>For each test case, print in a single line the earliest time that Dave can reach the destination after collecting all the treasures. If Dave cannot reach the destination, print -1.\n\n<h3>Example<\/h3>\n\n<pre>\n<b>Input:<\/b>\n4\n\n3\n...\n.##\n*#.\n\n3\n..*\n...\n...\n\n3\n..*\n*..\n...\n\n4\n....\n.#.*\n.#*.\n**#.\n\n<b>Output:<\/b>\n-1\n4\n6\n16\n<\/pre><\/p>    ","languages_supported":"NA","title":"N1","category":"NA","old_version":true,"problem_code":"N1"}

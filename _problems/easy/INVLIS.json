The problem is to find a longest increasing subsequence in a given permutation. A *permutation* of size $n$ is a sequence of $n$ numbers $a_1, \\ldots, a_n$ such that every number from $1$ to $n$ occurs in the sequence exactly once. An *increasing subsequence* of length $k$ of the sequence $a_1, \\ldots, a_n$ is a sequence of indices $i_1, \\ldots, i_k$ such that $1 \\leq i_1 < \\ldots < i_k \\leq n$ and $a_{i_1} < \\ldots < a_{i_k}$. A longest increasing subsequence is an increasing subsequences with the largest length. Note that in general there may be several longest increasing subsequences.\n\nPetya had some tests prepared, but then lost the input part for some of them. He now has a test for a certain value of $n$, and a sequence $i_1, \\ldots, i_k$ that is supposed to be a longest increasing subsequence. Petya now has to reconstruct a permutation of size $n$ with this sequence being an answer. Petya doesn't want to take any risks, so he additionally wants this sequence to be the **only** longest increasing subsequence, that is, all other increasing subsequences have to have **strictly smaller** length. Help Petya determine if this is possible, and if so, construct any such permutation.\n\n###Input:\n\nThe first line contains an integer $T$, denoting number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of every test case contains two integers $n$ and $k-$  the size of the permutation and the length of the longest increasing subsequence ($1 \\leq k \\leq n \\leq 10^5$).\n\nThe second line contains $k$ integers $i_1, \\ldots, i_k-$ the longest increasing subsequence ($1 \\leq i_1 < \\ldots < i_k \\leq n$).\n\n###Output:\nIf there is no permutation with the sequence $i_1, \\ldots, i_k$ being the only longest increasing subsequence, print `NO` . Otherwise, print `YES` on the first line, followed by $n$ numbers describing any suitable permutation on the second line.\n\n###Constraints \n- $1 \\leq T \\leq 10$\n- $1 \\leq k \\leq n \\leq 10^5$    \n- $1 \\leq i_1 < \\ldots < i_k \\leq n$    \n\n###Sample Input: \n```\n2\n3 2\n1 2\n2 1\n1\n```\n\n\n###Sample Output:\n```\nYES\n2 3 1\nNO\n```\n","languages_supported":"C, CPP14, JAVA, PYTH, PYTH 3.6, PYPY, CS2, PAS fpc, PAS gpc, RUBY, PHP, GO, NODEJS, HASK, rust, SCALA, swift, D, PERL, FORT, WSPC, ADA, CAML, ICK, BF, ASM, CLPS, PRLG, ICON, SCM qobi, PIKE, ST, NICE, LUA, BASH, NEM, LISP sbcl, LISP clisp, SCM guile, JS, ERL, TCL, kotlin, PERL6, TEXT, SCM chicken, PYP3, CLOJ, COB, FS","max_timelimit":"2","source_sizelimit":"50000","problem_author":"vijju123","problem_author_html_handle":"<span \n            class='rating' \n            style='display: inline-block; \n                    font-size: 10px; \n                    background: #FFBF00;\n                    padding: 0 3px; \n                    line-height: 1.3; \n                    color: white;\n                    margin-right: 2px;'>5&#9733;<\/span><span>vijju123<\/span>","problem_tester":null,"problem_tester_html_handle":"","date_added":"17-11-2018","tags":"<a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/vijju123'>vijju123<\/a>","time":{"view_start_date":1542546000,"submit_start_date":1542546000,"visible_start_date":1542546000,"end_date":1735669800,"current":1559472948},"user":{"username":"","access":"default"},"todo":false,"problem_status":"unattempted","is_direct_submittable":false}

All submissions for this problem are available.### Read problems statements in [Mandarin chinese](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/COOK97/mandarin/HACKFU.pdf), [Russian](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/COOK97/russian/HACKFU.pdf) and [Vietnamese](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/COOK97/vietnamese/HACKFU.pdf) as well.

The \*median\* of a sequence is the element in the middle of the sequence after it is sorted. For a sequence with even size, the median is the average of the two middle elements of the sequence after sorting. For example, for a sequence $A = \[1, 3, 3, 5, 4, 7, 11\]$, the median is equal to $4$, and for $A = \[2, 3, 4, 5\]$, the median is equal to $(3+4)/2 = 3.5$. Fulu is a famous programmer in his country. He wrote the following program (given in pseudocode) for finding the median in a sequence $A$ with length $N$: ``` read(N) read(A\[0\], A\[1\], ..., A\[N-1\]) sort(A) # simultaneously remove elements A\[K\] and A\[N mod K\] from the array A # the order of the remaining N-2 elements is unchanged remove(A\[K\], A\[N mod K\]) return A\[(N-2)/2\] # integer division ``` The program takes an integer $K$ as a parameter. Fulu can choose this integer arbitrarily between $1$ and $N-1$ inclusive. Little Lima, Fulu's friend, thinks Fulu's program is wrong (as always). As finding one counterexample would be an easy task for Lima (he has already found the sequence $A = \[34, 23, 35, 514\]$, which is a counterexample for any $K \\le 3$), Lima decided to make hacking more interesting. Fulu should give him four parameters $S, K, m, M$ (in addition to $N$) and Lima should find the lexicographically smallest \*proper\* sequence $A$ with length $N$ as a counterexample. We say that a sequence $A$ with length $N$ ($0$-indexed) is \*proper\* if it satisfies the following conditions: - it contains only positive integers - $A\_0 + A\_1 +A\_2 + \\dots + A\_{N-1} = S$ - $m \\le A\_i \\le M$ for each $0 \\le i \\lt N$ - the number returned by Fulu's program, ran with the given parameter $K$, is different from the correct median of the sequence $A$ Can you help Lima find the lexicographically smallest counterexample or determine that Fulu's program works perfectly for the given parameters? ### Input - The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows. - The first and only line of each test case contains five space-separated integers $N$, $S$, $K$, $m$ and $M$. ### Output For each test case, if there is no proper sequence, print a single line containing the integer $-1$; otherwise, print a single line containing $N$ space-separated integers â€” the lexicographically smallest proper sequence. ### Constraints - $1 \\le T \\le 8$ - $3 \\le N \\le 10^5$ - $1 \\le K \\le N-1$ - $1 \\le S \\le 10^9$ - $1 \\le m \\le M \\le S$ ### Example Input ``` 2 3 6 1 1 5 4 4 2 1 3 ``` ### Example Output ``` 1 1 4 -1 ``` ### Explanation \*\*Example case 1:\*\* For the sequence $A = \[1, 1, 4\]$, it is already sorted, so the program would just remove the first two elements ($K=1$, $N\\%K=0$) and return the only remaining element $4$. Obviously, the median of the original sequence is $1$. It can be shown that there is no lexicographically smaller proper sequence. \*\*Example case 2:\*\* The only possible sequence is $A = \[1, 1, 1, 1\]$, which is not proper, since Fulu's program will give the correct answer $1$ for it.

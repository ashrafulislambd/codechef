Umesh, a puzzle fanatic at IIT Roorkee, had an idea for a new kind of searching puzzle. In the letter matrix provided, words can be located along any set of diagonals, with repetition of past selected letters.<\/p>\n<p>For example, in the letter matrix:<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<pre>B X A X X<br \/>X A X X X<br \/>X B B X X<br \/>X A X A X<br \/>X X B X X<br \/><br \/><br \/><\/pre><p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>The string ABA can be found in 14 different ways \u2013 corresponding to the following locations:<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<pre>A\t        B\t        A<br \/>(1,1)\t(0,0)\t(1,1)<br \/>(1,1)\t(2,2)\t(3,1)<br \/>(1,1)\t(2,2)\t(3,3)<br \/>(1,1)\t(2,2)\t(1,1)<br \/>(3,1)\t(2,2)\t(3,1)<br \/>(3,1)\t(2,2)\t(3,3)<br \/>(3,1)\t(4,2)\t(3,1)<br \/>(3,1)\t(4,2)\t(3,3)<br \/>(3,1)\t(2,2)\t(1,1)<br \/>(3,3)\t(2,2)\t(3,3)<br \/>(3,3)\t(2,2)\t(1,1)<br \/>(3,3)\t(2,2)\t(3,1)<br \/>(3,3)\t(4,2)\t(3,1)<br \/>(3,3)\t(4,2)\t(3,3)<br \/><\/pre><p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p> So, given a matrix of size NxN, you need to find out the total number of locations of a particular string. The input and output formats are as follows:<\/p>\n<h3>Input<\/h3>\n<p>Line 1: N. 1 &lt;= N &lt;= 1000<br \/> Line 2 to N+1: Elements of the NxN matrix in row major order (separated by a space)<br \/> Line N+2: The string to search. Maximum length of this string will be N2.<\/p>\n<h3>Output<\/h3>\n<p>Line 1: The number of ways in which the string can be found in the matrix.<\/p>\n<h3>Example<\/h3>\n<pre><b>Input:<\/b><br \/>5<br \/>B X A X X<br \/>X A X X X<br \/>X B B X X<br \/>X A X A X<br \/>X X B X X<br \/>ABA<br \/><br \/><b>Output:<\/b><br \/>14<br \/><\/pre><p>\n<\/p>    ","languages_supported":"NA","title":"INSOMA2","category":"NA","old_version":true,"problem_code":"INSOMA2"}

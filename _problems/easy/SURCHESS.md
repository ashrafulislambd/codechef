All submissions for this problem are available.\###Read problems statements \[Hindi\](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/OCT18/hindi/SURCHESS.pdf) ,\[Bengali\](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/OCT18/bengali/SURCHESS.pdf) , \[Mandarin chinese\](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/OCT18/mandarin/SURCHESS.pdf) , \[Russian\](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/OCT18/russian/SURCHESS.pdf) and \[Vietnamese\](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/OCT18/vietnamese/SURCHESS.pdf) as well. Chef loves to play chess, so he bought a new chessboard with width $M$ and height $N$ recently. Chef considers a chessboard \*correct\* if its width (number of columns) is equal to its height (number of rows) and each cell has no side-adjacent cell of the same color (this is the so-called "chess order" which you can see in real-world chessboards). Chef's chessboard does not have to be a correct chessboard (in particular, it may have $N \\neq M$). A \*sub-board\* of Chef's chessboard is a rectangular piece of this board with an arbitrarily chosen top left and bottom right cell (possibly equal to the original chessboard). Every sub-board is also a chessboard. Chef can invert some cells; inverting a cell means changing its color from white to black or from black to white. After inverting those cells, he wants to cut the maximum correct sub-board out of the original chessboard. Chef has not yet decided how many cells he would like to invert. Now he wonders about the answers to $Q$ question. In the $i$-th question ($1 \\le i \\le Q$), he is allowed to invert at most $c\_i$ cells (possibly zero); he would like to know the side length of the largest possible correct sub-board of his chessboard. Help Chef answer these questions. ### Input - The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $M$. - $N$ lines follow. For each valid $i$, the $i$-th of these lines contains a string with length $M$ describing the $i$-th row of Chef's chessboard. Each character of this string is either '0', representing a black cell, or '1', representing a white cell. - The next line contains a single integer $Q$. - The last line contains $Q$ space-separated integers $c\_1, c\_2, \\dots, c\_Q$. ### Output For each question, print a single line containing one integer â€” the maximum size of a correct sub-board. ### Constraints - $1 \\le N, M \\le 200$ - $1 \\le Q \\le 10^5$ - $0 \\le c\_i \\le 10^9$ for each valid $i$ ### Subtasks \*\*Subtask #1 (20 points):\*\* - $1 \\le N, M \\le 20$ - $1 \\le Q \\le 100$ \*\*Subtask #2 (30 points):\*\* $1 \\le N, M \\le 20$ \*\*Subtask #3 (50 points):\*\* original constraints ### Example Input ``` 8 8 00101010 00010101 10101010 01010101 10101010 01010101 10101010 01010101 4 1 2 0 1001 ``` ### Example Output ``` 7 8 6 8 ``` ### Explanation If we don't change the board, the best answer here is the 6x6 bottom right sub-board. We can invert cells $(2, 2)$ and $(1, 1)$ to get a better answer.

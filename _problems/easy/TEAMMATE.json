Since Snackdown is a contest of teams with up to two members, everyone is looking for a teammate. There are $N$ contestants (numbered $1$ through $N$) who want to participate in Snackdown; let's denote the skill level of the $i$-th contestant by $S_i$. These people want to pair up in $N\/2$ teams; each team should consist of two people.\n\nClearly everyone wishes for their teammate to be as skilled as possible, so everyone wants to maximize their teammate's skill level. We call a pairing (an unordered $N\/2$-tuple of teams) *valid* if there are no two teams consisting of people $(A, B)$ and $(C, D)$ such that $S_D \\gt S_B$ and $S_A \\gt S_C$ \u2014 in that case, $A$ and $D$ would both prefer to be on the same team rather than with their current teammates.\n\nFind the number of valid pairings. Since this number can be large, compute it modulo $1,000,000,007$.\n\n### Input\n- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.\n- The first line of each test case contains a single integer $N$.\n- The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $S_1, S_2, \\dots, S_N$.\n\n### Output\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \u2014 the number of valid pairings modulo $1,000,000,007$.\n\n### Constraints \n- $1 \\le T \\le 1,000$\n- $2 \\le N \\le 10^5$\n- $N$ is even\n- the sum of $N$ for all test cases does not exceed $10^6$\n- $1 \\le S_i \\le 10^6$ for each valid $i$\n\n### Example Input\n```\n2\n4\n1 7 3 8\n4\n2 3 2 2\n```\n\n### Example Output\n```\n1\n3\n```\n\n### Explanation\n**Example case 1:** The only valid pairing is for contestant $2$ to be paired with contestant $4$ (so contestants $1$ and $3$ form the other team).\n\n**Example case 2:** Since person $2$ has the highest skill level and all others have the same skill levels, person $2$ can choose anyone among the other three as a teammate. The remaining two people also form a team, so the number of pairings is $3$.\n","languages_supported":"C, CPP14, JAVA, PYTH, PYTH 3.6, PYPY, CS2, PAS fpc, PAS gpc, RUBY, PHP, GO, NODEJS, HASK, rust, SCALA, swift, D, PERL, FORT, WSPC, ADA, CAML, ICK, BF, ASM, CLPS, PRLG, ICON, SCM qobi, PIKE, ST, NICE, LUA, BASH, NEM, LISP sbcl, LISP clisp, SCM guile, JS, ERL, TCL, kotlin, PERL6, TEXT, SCM chicken, PYP3, CLOJ, COB, FS","max_timelimit":"1","source_sizelimit":"50000","problem_author":"kingofnumbers","problem_author_html_handle":"<span \n            class='rating' \n            style='display: inline-block; \n                    font-size: 10px; \n                    background: #FF7F00;\n                    padding: 0 3px; \n                    line-height: 1.3; \n                    color: white;\n                    margin-right: 2px;'>6&#9733;<\/span><span>kingofnumbers<\/span>","problem_tester":null,"problem_tester_html_handle":"","date_added":"10-10-2018","tags":"<a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/combinatorics'>combinatorics<\/a>, <a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/easy-medium'>easy-medium<\/a>, <a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/kingofnumbers'>kingofnumbers<\/a>, <a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/snckql19'>snckql19<\/a>, <a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/taran_1407'>taran_1407<\/a>","editorial_url":"https:\/\/discuss.codechef.com\/problems\/TEAMMATE","time":{"view_start_date":1539698400,"submit_start_date":1539698400,"visible_start_date":1539698400,"end_date":1735669800,"current":1559472962},"user":{"username":"","access":"default"},"todo":false,"problem_status":"unattempted","is_direct_submittable":false}

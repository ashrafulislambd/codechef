{"body":"\n<h3> All submissions for this problem are available. <\/h3><p>Johnny has some difficulty memorizing the small prime numbers. So, his computer science teacher has asked him to play with the following puzzle game frequently.<\/p>\n<p>The puzzle is a 3x3 board consisting of numbers from 1 to 9. The objective of the puzzle is to swap the tiles until the following final state is reached:<\/p>\n<pre>1 2 3\n4 5 6\n7 8 9\n<\/pre>\n<p>At each step, Johnny may swap two adjacent tiles <b>if their sum is a prime number.<\/b> Two tiles are considered adjacent if they have a common edge.<\/p>\n<p>Help Johnny to find the shortest number of steps needed to reach the goal state.<\/p>\n<h3>Input<\/h3>\n<p>The first line contains t, the number of test cases (about 50). Then t test cases follow. Each test case consists of a 3x3 table describing a puzzle which Johnny would like to solve.<\/p>\n<p>The input data for successive test cases is separated by a blank line.<\/p>\n<h3>Output<\/h3>\n<p>For each test case print a single line containing the shortest number of steps needed to solve the corresponding puzzle. If there is no way to reach the final state, print the number -1.<\/p>\n<h3>Example<\/h3>\n<pre><b>Input:<\/b>\n2\n\n7 3 2 \n4 1 5 \n6 8 9 \n\n9 8 5 \n2 4 1 \n3 7 6  \n\n<b>Output:<\/b>\n6\n-1\n<\/pre>\n<h3>Output details<\/h3>\n<p>The possible 6 steps in the first test case are described in the following figure:<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"\/themes\/abessive\/images\/contests\/h1.png\" \/><\/p>\n<p><\/p>    ","languages_supported":"NA","title":"H1","category":"NA","old_version":true,"problem_code":"H1"}

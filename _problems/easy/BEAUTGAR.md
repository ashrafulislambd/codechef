All submissions for this problem are available.\###Read problems statements in \[Hindi\](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/CK100TST/hindi/BEAUTGAR.pdf), \[Mandarin Chinese\](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/CK100TST/mandarin/BEAUTGAR.pdf), \[Russian\](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/CK100TST/russian/BEAUTGAR.pdf), \[Vietnamese\](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/CK100TST/vietnamese/BEAUTGAR.pdf) and \[Bengali\](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/CK100TST/bengali/BEAUTGAR.pdf) as well. There is a garland â€” a cyclic rope with red and green flowers on it in some order. The sequence of flower colours is described by a string $s$; since the rope is cyclic, each two consecutive flowers are adjacent and the first and last flower are also adjacent. The garland is \*beautiful\* if there is no pair of adjacent flowers with identical colours. You want the garland to be beautiful. To achieve that, you may perform the following operation at most once: - Make two cuts on the rope (not intersecting the flowers), splitting the garland into two parts. - Reverse one of these two parts. - Tie together corresponding endpoints of the two parts, creating one whole garland again. Can you find out whether it is possible to make the garland beautiful? ### Input - The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows. - The first and only line of each test case contains a single string $s$ describing the garland. Each character of $s$ is either 'R' or 'G', denoting a red or green flower respectively. ### Output For each test case, print a single line containing the string `"yes"` if the garland can be made beautiful or `"no"` otherwise. ### Constraints - $1 \\le T \\le 10^5$ - $2 \\le |s| \\le 10^5$ - the sum of $|s|$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^6$ ### Example Input ``` 3 RG RRGG RR ``` ### Example Output ``` yes yes no ``` ### Explanation \*\*Example case 1:\*\* The garland is already beautiful. \*\*Example case 2:\*\* We can cut the garland between flowers 1 and 2 and between flowers 3 and 4. After reversing the part containing flowers 2 and 3 and rejoining, we obtain "RGRG".

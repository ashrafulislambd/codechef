{"body":"\n<h3> All submissions for this problem are available. <\/h3><p>\nWe call an array of integers X of size N good if it can be partitioned into 2 arrays of size n\/2, say p1[] and p2[], such that p1[0] + p2[0] = p1[1] + p2[1] = p1[2] + p2[2] = ... . Given an array Y, determine the size of its largest subset which is a good array.\n\n<h3>Input<\/h3>\n<\/p><p>\nThe first line contains the integer N.\n\nThe next line contains N space separated integers, which are the elements of the array X.\n\n\n<h3>Output<\/h3>\n<\/p><p>\nOne number which is the size of the greatest subset as mentioned in the problem statement.\n\n<h3>Example<\/h3>\n\n<pre>\n<b>Input:<\/b>\n6\n\n1 4 2 3 8 10 \n<b>Output:<\/b>\n4\n<b>Explanation:<\/b>\nThe array {1,4,2,3} is good, since you can form p1[] = {1,2} and p2[] = {4,3}.

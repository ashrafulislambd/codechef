{"body":"\n<h3> All submissions for this problem are available. <\/h3><p>There is a line with 1000 cells numbered from 1 to 1000 from left to right and <b>N<\/b> coins placed on it. Coin <b>i<\/b> is placed at cell <b>X<sub>i<\/sub><\/b>, and no two coins are placed at the same cell.\n\n<\/p><p>Bob would like to move the coins to the <b>N<\/b> leftmost cells of the line. To do this, he is allowed to take a coin from any cell <b>T<\/b> and move it to cell <b>T<\/b>-<b>j<\/b>, where <b>j<\/b> is an integer between 1 and <b>K<\/b>, inclusive. This action is possible only if:\n<ul><li> cell <b>T<\/b>-<b>j<\/b> actually exists and doesn't contain a coin;\n<\/li><li> each of the cells <b>T<\/b>-<b>j<\/b>+1, ..., <b>T<\/b>-1 contains a coin.<\/li><\/ul><br \/>\n\n<\/p><p>One coin movement takes exactly one second. Find the smallest time in which Bob can achieve his goal.\n\n<h3>Input<\/h3>\n<\/p><p>The first line of the input file contains one integer <b>T<\/b> -- the number of test cases (no more than 10). Then <b>T<\/b> test cases follow, and every test case is described by two lines: the first of them contains two integers <b>N<\/b> and <b>K<\/b> (1 &lt;= <b>N<\/b>, <b>K<\/b> &lt;= 1000), the second of them contains <b>N<\/b> integers <b>X<sub>1<\/sub><\/b>, ..., <b>X<sub>N<\/sub><\/b> in strictly increasing order (1 &lt;= <b>X<sub>i<\/sub><\/b> &lt;= 1000).\n\n<h3>Output<\/h3>\n<\/p><p>For each test case output one line containing the requested minimal time for Bob to put all the coins to the left side of the line.\n\n<h3>Example<\/h3>\n\n<pre>\n<b>Input:<\/b>\n2\n3 2\n2 4 7\n5 3\n1 2 3 4 5\n\n<b>Output:<\/b>\n5\n0\n\n<b>Explanation:<\/b>\n<\/pre>\nIn the first example Bob can move the coin from cell 7 consequently to cells 6, 5, 3 and 1, then move the coin from cell 4 to cell 3. In the second example there is nothing to move.<\/p>    ","languages_supported":"NA","title":"MVCOIN","category":"NA","old_version":true,"problem_code":"MVCOIN"}

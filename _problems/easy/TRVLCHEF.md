All submissions for this problem are available.\###Read problems statements \[Mandarin\](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME70/mandarin/TRVLCHEF.pdf) , \[Bengali\](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME70/bengali/TRVLCHEF.pdf) , \[Hindi\](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME70/hindi/TRVLCHEF.pdf) , \[Russian\](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME70/russian/TRVLCHEF.pdf) and \[Vietnamese\](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/LTIME70/vietnamese/TRVLCHEF.pdf) as well. Chef works in a similar way to a travelling salesman â€• he always travels to new cities in order to sell his delicious dishes. Today, Chef is planning to visit $N$ cities (numbered $1$ through $N$). There is a direct way to travel between each pair of cities. Each city has a specific temperature; let's denote the temperature in the $i$-th city by $C\_i$. Chef has a fixed temperature tolerance $D$ with the following meaning: for each pair of cities $a$ and $b$, he may travel from city $a$ directly to city $b$ only if $|C\_a-C\_b| \\le D$, otherwise he would catch a heavy flu because of the sudden change in temperature. Chef starts from city $1$. Is he able to visit all $N$ cities in such a way that each city is visited \*\*exactly once\*\*? Notes: - Chef is not able to travel through a city without visiting it. - City $1$ is visited at the beginning. - It is not necessary to be able to travel directly to city $1$ from the last city Chef visits. ### Input - The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows. - The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $D$. - The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $C\_1, C\_2, \\ldots, C\_N$. ### Output For each test case, print a single line containing the string `"YES"` (without quotes) if Chef can visit all cities or `"NO"` (without quotes) if he cannot. ### Constraints - $1 \\le T \\le 1,000$ - $2 \\le N \\le 10^5$ - $0 \\le D \\le 10^9$ - $0 \\le C\_i \\le 10^9$ for each valid $i$ - the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^6$ ### Subtasks \*\*Subtask #1 (20 points):\*\* - $N \\le 1,000$ - the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $10,000$ \*\*Subtask #2 (80 points):\*\* original constraints ### Example Input ``` 2 5 3 3 2 1 4 5 5 4 10 1 3 2 9 ``` ### Example Output ``` YES NO ```

Before going for vacations, students of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry had their end semester exams.\n\n$N$ students attended the semester exam. Once the exam was over, their results were displayed as either \"Pass\" or \"Fail\" behind their magic jacket which they wore. A student cannot see his\/her result but can see everyone else's results. Each of $N$ students count the number of passed students they can see.\n\nGiven the number of \"Pass\" verdicts that each of the $N$ students counted, we have to figure out conclusively, the number of students who failed, or report that there is some inconsistency or that we cannot be sure.\n\n###Input:\n- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. \n- The first line of each test case will contain $N$, representing the number of students who attended the exam.\n- Next line contains  $N$ spaced integers representing the number of \"Pass\" counted by each of the $N$ students.\n\n###Output:\n- For each test case, output the answer in a single line. \n- If the counts reported by the students are not consistent with each other or if it's not possible to predict the number of failed students from the given input, then print -1.\n\n###Constraints \n- $1 \\leq T \\leq 50$\n- $1 \\leq N \\leq 10^{5}$\n- $0 \\leq$ Count given by each Student $\\leq 10^{5}$\n\n###Sample Input:\n```\n1\n4\n3 2 2 2\n```\n\n###Sample Output:\n```\n1\n```\n\n###EXPLANATION:\nThere are 4 students, and they counted the number of passed students as 3,2,2,2. The first student can see that all others have passed, and all other students can see only 2 students who have passed. Hence, the first student must have failed, and others have all passed. Hence, the answer is 1.","languages_supported":"C, CPP14, JAVA, PYTH, PYTH 3.6, PYPY, CS2, PAS fpc, PAS gpc, RUBY, PHP, GO, NODEJS, HASK, rust, SCALA, swift, D, PERL, FORT, WSPC, ADA, CAML, ICK, BF, ASM, CLPS, PRLG, ICON, SCM qobi, PIKE, ST, NICE, LUA, BASH, NEM, LISP sbcl, LISP clisp, SCM guile, JS, ERL, TCL, kotlin, PERL6, TEXT, SCM chicken, PYP3, CLOJ, R, COB, FS","max_timelimit":"1","source_sizelimit":"50000","problem_author":"bipin2","problem_author_html_handle":"<span \n            class='rating' \n            style='display: inline-block; \n                    font-size: 10px; \n                    background: #3366CC;\n                    padding: 0 3px; \n                    line-height: 1.3; \n                    color: white;\n                    margin-right: 2px;'>3&#9733;<\/span><span>bipin2<\/span>","problem_tester":null,"problem_tester_html_handle":"","date_added":"20-12-2018","tags":"<a class='problem-tag-small ' href='\/tags\/problems\/bipin2'>bipin2<\/a>","time":{"view_start_date":1546074900,"submit_start_date":1546074900,"visible_start_date":1546074900,"end_date":1735669800,"current":1559472940},"user":{"username":"","access":"default"},"todo":false,"problem_status":"unattempted","is_direct_submittable":false}

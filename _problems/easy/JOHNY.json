He lives in Sam's Town. A few days ago he had a birthday, so his parents gave him a gift: MP3-player! Vlad was the happiest man in the world! Now he can listen his favorite songs whenever he wants!<\/p>\n<p>Vlad built up his own playlist. The playlist consists of <b>N<\/b> songs, each has a <b>unique<\/b> positive integer length. Vlad likes all the songs from his playlist, but there is a song, which he likes more than the others. It's named \"Uncle Johny\".<\/p>\n<p>After creation of the playlist, Vlad decided to sort the songs in increasing order of their lengths. For example, if the lengths of the songs in playlist was {1, 3, 5, 2, 4} after sorting it becomes {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. Before the sorting, \"Uncle Johny\" was on <b>K<\/b>-th position (1-indexing is assumed for the playlist) in the playlist.<\/p>\n<p>Vlad needs your help! He gives you all the information of his playlist. Your task is to find the position of \"Uncle Johny\" in  the sorted playlist.<\/p>\n\n<h3>Input<\/h3>\nThe first line of the input contains an integer <b>T<\/b> denoting the number of test cases.

All submissions for this problem are available.### Read problems statements in [Mandarin chinese](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/COOK95/mandarin/GOODPERM.pdf), [Russian](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/COOK95/russian/GOODPERM.pdf) and [Vietnamese](http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/COOK95/vietnamese/GOODPERM.pdf) as well.

You have a sequence $a$ with length $N$ created by removing some elements (possibly zero) from a permutation of numbers $(1, 2, \\dots, N)$. When an element is removed, the length of the sequence doesn't change, but there is an empty spot left where the removed element was. You also have an integer $K$. Let's call a permutation $p\_1, p\_2, \\dots, p\_N$ \*good\* if: - it is possible replace empty spots in $a$ by numbers in such a way that we obtain the permutation $p$ - the number of positions $i$ ($1 \\lt i \\le N$) such that $p\_i \\gt p\_{i-1}$ is equal to $K$ Your task is to find the number of good permutations. ### Input - The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows. - The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $K$. - The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $a\_1, a\_2, \\dots, a\_N$. Each element of this sequence is either $0$ (indicating an empty spot previously occupied by a removed element) or an integer between $1$ and $N$ inclusive. ### Output For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€” the number of good permutations. ### Constraints - $1 \\le T \\le 300$ - $0 \\le K \\lt N \\le 8$ - each integer between $1$ and $N$ inclusive appears in $a$ at most once ### Example Input ``` 1 3 1 2 0 0 ``` ### Example Output ``` 2 ``` ### Explanation \*\*Example case 1:\*\* The two possible good permutations are $(2,3,1)$ and $(2,1,3)$.

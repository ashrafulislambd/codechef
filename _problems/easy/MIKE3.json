He has a lot of rare and unusual ones in his collection. Unfortunately, a few days ago he was fired from his well-paid job.<\/p>\n<p>But he doesn't complain about that, he acts! That's why Mike picked up <b>N<\/b> stamps from his collection and is going to sell them. He has already placed an announcement on the Internet and got <b>M<\/b> offers. Each offer can be described as a set of stamps, that the buyer wants to buy. Now Mike needs your help to choose a set of offers, that he should accept. <\/p>\n<p>He can't accept offers partially. Also, as far as Mike has the only copy of each stamp, he can sell one stamp to at most one buyer.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, Mike wants to maximize the number of accepted offers. Help him!\n<\/p>\n<h3>Input<\/h3>\n\n<p>The first line contains two integer <b>N<\/b> and <b>M<\/b>, denoting the number of the stamps and the number of the offers.<\/p>\n<p>The next <b>M<\/b> lines contain the descriptions of the offers.

Vanja and Miksi have already finished everything for this year at their university, so they decided to spend their free time playing a game with a \*binary\* sequence $A\_1, A\_2, \\dots, A\_N$ (i.e. a sequence containing only integers $0$ and $1$). At the beginning of the game, Vanja and Miksi write down the expression $\* A\_1 \* A\_2 \* A\_3 \* \\ldots \* A\_N$ (note below that each $\*$ is a placeholder and does not denote multiplication). The players take turns alternately, starting with Vanja. The game lasts $N$ turns. In each turn, the current player must replace the first (leftmost) remaining $\*$ by the sign $+$ or $-$ (or, equivalently, by the operation of addition or subtraction). After the last turn, the boys calculate the resulting value $V$ of the expression. If $|V| \\ge K$, the winner is Vanja; otherwise, the winner is Miksi. Please predict the winner of the game if both players play optimally. ### Input - The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows. - The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $K$. - The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $A\_1, A\_2, \\dots, A\_N$. ### Output For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€” $1$ if Vanja (the first player) is the winner or $2$ if Miksi (the second player) is the winner. ### Constraints - $1 \\le T \\le 50$ - $1 \\le N \\le 3 \\cdot 10^4$ - $0 \\le K \\le 3 \\cdot 10^4$ - $0 \\le A\_i \\le 1$ for each valid $i$ ### Example Input ``` 2 2 1 1 0 3 5 0 1 0 ``` ### Example Output ``` 1 2 ``` ### Explanation \*\*Example case 1:\*\* $K = 1$, so if Vanja replaces the first $\*$ by $+$, the value of the final expression will be $V = 1$; then, $K \\le |V|$, so the winner is Vanja. \*\*Example case 2:\*\* $K = 5$, but the absolute value of the final expression cannot be greater than $1$. The winner is Miksi.

He can't choose less than <b>K<\/b> since it will be not enough to complete the order in time. On the other hand if he chooses more than <b>K<\/b> subordinates he can't control them during the operation. Help him to find the number of ways he can choose the team to complete this very important order.\n\n<h3>Input<\/h3>\n<\/p><p> The first line contains a single positive integer <b>T &lt;= 100<\/b>, the number of test cases. <b>T<\/b> test cases follow. The only line of each test case contains two integers <b>N<\/b> and <b>K<\/b>, where <b>0 &lt;= N, K &lt; 2^64<\/b>. It is guaranteed that the answer will be less than <b>2^64<\/b>.\n\n<h3>Output<\/h3>\n<\/p><p> For each test case, output a single line containing the number of ways to choose the required team.\n\n<h3>Example<\/h3>\n\n<pre>\n<b>Input:<\/b>\n3\n2 1\n3 3\n10 5\n\n<b>Output:<\/b>\n2\n1\n252\n<\/pre><\/p>    ","languages_supported":"NA","title":"CHEFTEAM","category":"NA","old_version":true,"problem_code":"CHEFTEAM"}

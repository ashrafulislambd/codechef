Now he considers a rectangular grid that contains only zeroes and ones and has size <b>N x M<\/b>. He considers the <b>(L, K)<\/b>-window here as any submatrix of size <b>L x K<\/b> that contains only ones. Formally he defines <b>(L, K)<\/b>-window as any <b>(K+L)<\/b>-tuple <b>(R<sub>1<\/sub>, ..., R<sub>L<\/sub>, C<sub>1<\/sub>, ..., C<sub>K<\/sub>)<\/b> such that <b>1 &lt;= R<sub>1<\/sub> &lt; ... &lt; R<sub>L<\/sub> &lt;= N<\/b>, <b>1 &lt;= C<sub>1<\/sub>  &lt; ... &lt; C<sub>K<\/sub> &lt;= M<\/b> and <b>A[R<sub>i<\/sub>][C<sub>j<\/sub>]=1<\/b> for all <b>1 &lt;= i &lt;= L, 1&lt;= j &lt;= K<\/b>. Here <b>A[r][c]<\/b> is the <b>c<\/b>-th element of the <b>r<\/b>-th row of considered rectangular grid.\n<br \/><br \/>\nWhy does Chef call some <b>(K+L)<\/b>-tuple of numbers by the window? Just mark all points <b>(R<sub>i<\/sub>,C<sub>j<\/sub>)<\/b> (<b>1 &lt;= i &lt;= L, 1&lt;= j &lt;= K<\/b>) on the plane and join by line segments all pairs of points that has equal abscises or ordinates and you will see that this picture is like a window.\n<br \/><br \/>\nNow Chef considers some particular <b>N x M<\/b> grid and wants to calculate the total number of <b>(L, K)<\/b>-windows in this rectangular grid. Help him. Since this number can be very large calculate the result modulo <b>1000000080798150871<\/b>.\n\n<h3>Input<\/h3>\n<\/p><p> The first line contains a single positive integer <b>T &lt;= 100<\/b>, the number of test cases. <b>T<\/b> test cases follow. The first line of each test case contains four positive integers <b>N, M, L, K<\/b>, where <b>L, N &lt;= 1000, K, M &lt;=3<\/b>. Next <b>N<\/b> lines describe the rectangular grid considered by Chef. Each of these lines contains <b>M<\/b> symbols. Every symbol is either one or zero.\n\n<h3>Output<\/h3>\n<\/p><p> For each test case, output a single line containing the total number of <b>(L, K)<\/b>-windows for the given grid modulo <b>1000000080798150871<\/b>.\n\n<h3>Example<\/h3>\n\n<pre>\n<b>Input:<\/b>\n2\n3 2 2 1\n11\n01\n10\n3 3 2 2\n111\n101\n111\n\n<b>Output:<\/b>\n2\n5\n<\/pre>\n\n<h3>Explanation<\/h3>\nIn the first case it is just the number of pairs of cells with value 1 that have the same column number.\n<br \/><br \/>\nIn the second case we have the following <b>(2, 2)<\/b>-windows:\n<br \/>\n(First row, Second row, First column, Third column)\n<br \/>\n(First row, Third row, First column, Second column)\n<br \/>\n(First row, Third row, First column, Third column)\n<br \/>\n(First row, Third row, Second column, Third column)\n<br \/>\n(Second row, Third row, First column, Third column)<\/p>    ","languages_supported":"NA","title":"WINDOW2","category":"NA","old_version":true,"problem_code":"WINDOW2"}

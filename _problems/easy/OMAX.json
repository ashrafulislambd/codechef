{"body":"\n<h3> All submissions for this problem are available. <\/h3><p>Given a matrix sized m x n, we define an O-region as a non-empty sub-block with another non-empty sub-block inside removed, such that the removed sub-block has no common boundaries with the outside.  That is, the leftmost column of the removed sub-block must be different from the leftmost column of the outer sub-block, and similarly the rightmost columns, topmost rows, and bottommost rows are different. The removal of the inner sub-block leaves a region which looks like the letter O.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>The value of an O-region is the sum of all numbers in the outer sub-block but not in the removed one. Your task is finding the maximal value of all O-regions appearing in the given matrix.\n<\/p>\n\n<h3>Input<\/h3>\n<p>There are several test cases (fifteen at most), each formed as follows:\n<ul>\n<li>The first line contains two positive integers m, n (3 \u2264 m, n \u2264 77).<\/li>\n<li>m lines follow, each containing n integers (each having an absolute value of 10<sup>5<\/sup> at most) describing the matrix.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nThe input is ended with m = n = 0.\n<\/p>\n\n<h3>Output<\/h3>\n<p>For each test case, output on a line an integer which is the respective maximal value found.\n<\/p>\n\n<h3>Example<\/h3>\n\n<pre>\n<b>Input:<\/b>\n3 3\n1 1 1\n1 3 -1\n1 1 1\n4 5\n1 -2 3 -4 5\n-5 4 -3 2 -1\n1 -3 5 -7 9\n-9 7 -5 3 -1\n0 0\n<b>Output:<\/b>\n6\n19\n<\/pre>    ","languages_supported":"NA","title":"OMAX","category":"NA","old_version":true,"problem_code":"OMAX"}

{"category_name":"easy","status":"success","problem_code":"DREAM","problem_name":"Chef&#39;s Dream","body":"<span class=\"solution-visible-txt\">All submissions for this problem are available.<\/span><p align=\"justify\">   The Chef is sleeping now. He tries to cook new kind of meals in his dream.<br \/> <br \/>\nThese meals are arranged in a row and numbered from 1 to <b>N<\/b> consecutively. For each meal <i>i<\/i> (1&lt;=<i>i<\/i>&lt;=<b>N<\/b>) there \n\nis given one integer <i>f(i)<\/i> which denotes the time needed to cook it. Initially, all meals are uncooked. Each assistant \n\nof The Chef (there are infinite number of them) can help him with cooking.<br \/> <br \/>\nThe abilities of all assistants are same. There can be at most one assistant cooking at each moment. He must choose some \n\ncontinuous subsequence of meals with length <b>K<\/b>(any such subsequence can be chosen). And if there are uncooked meals in \n\nit, he will cook all uncooked meals which has the minimum cooking time among uncooked meals in the chosen subsequence. \n\nNothing done to another meals.\n<br \/> <br \/>\n\n   The dream was so interesting that he tried to solve such a problem: What is the minimum number of assistants which can \n\ncook all the meals assuming that each of them will cook at most once?\n   But since the bell rings and Chef's friends has come to visit him, he will wake up after 2 seconds. Your program \n\nshould calculate the answer before The Chef will come to himself.\n<h3>Input<\/h3>\n<\/p><p>First line of input file contains two integers <b>N<\/b> (1&lt;=<b>N<\/b>&lt;=10<sup>5<\/sup>) and <b>K<\/b> (1&lt;=<b>K<\/b>&lt;=<b>N<\/b>), \n\nfollowed by a line containing <b>N<\/b> integers.

In how many ways, can I choose <b>K<\/b> elements from the class to sit down, if I see them as being distinct?\" <\/p>\n<p>Lira replied immediately with the right answer, so, the teacher decided to make the game a little funnier: \"Okay Lira, as you are so fast, now I want you to tell me exactly the same thing, but, with the addition that the value of <b>K<\/b> is changing, this is, I want you to tell me the sum of the number of ways I can sit down <b>K<\/b> of you, if the value of <b>K<\/b> goes from 1 (meaning that there are no chairs in the classroom but one) to N (meaning that all of your chairs arrived). Can you be as fast now? As the answer might get large I want you to tell me the result modulo 1000000007.

All submissions for this problem are available.You were strolling outside the restaurant at the end of the universe. On a metaspiral path you stumble upon a weird device which takes a three-digit number as input and processes it. The Hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy explains that it processes the input in the following manner: - Multiplies it with 13, followed by 11 and then 7 - Outputs all the distinct three-digit numbers possible from the digits of the new number (each digit can only be used once) Your friend Zaphod is in a playful mood, and does the following with the device- - Given a three-digit positive number $K$, he feeds it to the device for processing. - He then takes the numbers it gives as output, and send each of them through the device and again collect all the numbers sent out. - Repeats the above step $N$ times. To test your wit, he challenges you to find the number of distinct 3-digit numbers which the device outputs over the $N$ steps. Can you? ###Input: - First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. - Each testcase contains of a single line of input, two integers $K, N$. ###Output: For each testcase, output a single integer denoting the number of distinct 3-digit numbers which the device outputs over the $N$ steps. ###Constraints - $1 \\leq T \\leq 1000$ - $5 \\leq N \\leq 10^9$ - Each digit of $K$ is non-zero ###Sample Input: 1 123 5 ###Sample Output: 27

Suppose we have a collection S<sub>1<\/sub>, S<sub>2<\/sub>, ..., S<sub>m<\/sub> of subsets of X. Say an atom A is a subset of X such that for each S<sub>i<\/sub> we have either A is a subset of S<sub>i<\/sub> or A and S<sub>i<\/sub> do not have any common elements.\n\n<\/p><p>\nYour task is to find a collection A<sub>1<\/sub>, ..., A<sub>k<\/sub> of atoms such that every item in X is in some A<sub>i<\/sub> and no two A<sub>i<\/sub>, A<sub>j<\/sub> with i \u2260 j share a common item. Surely such a collection exists as we could create a single set {x} for each x in X. A more interesting question is to minimize k, the number of atoms.\n\n<h3>Input<\/h3>\n<\/p><p>\nThe first line contains a single positive integer t \u2264 30 indicating the number of test cases. Each test case begins with two integers n,m where n is the size of X and m is the number of sets S<sub>i<\/sub>. Then m lines follow where the i'th such line begins with an integer v<sub>i<\/sub> between 1 and n (inclusive) indicating the size of S<sub>i<\/sub>. Following this are v<sub>i<\/sub> distinct integers between 0 and n-1 that describe the contents of S<sub>i<\/sub>.\n\n<\/p><p>\nYou are guaranteed that 1 \u2264 n \u2264 100 and 1 \u2264 m \u2264 \n30. Furthermore, each number between 0 and n-1 will appear in at least one set S<sub>i<\/sub>.\n<h3>Output<\/h3>\n<\/p><p>\nFor each test case you are to output a single integer indicating the minimum number of atoms that X can be partitioned into to satisfy the constraints.\n\n<h3>Example<\/h3>\n\n<pre>\n<b>Input:<\/b>\n2\n5 2\n3 0 1 2\n3 2 3 4\n4 3\n2 0 1\n2 1 2\n2 2 3\n\n<b>Output:<\/b>\n3\n4\n<\/pre><\/p>    ","languages_supported":"NA","title":"ATOMS","category":"NA","old_version":true,"problem_code":"ATOMS"}

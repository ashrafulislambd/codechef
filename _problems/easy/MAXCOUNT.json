{"body":"\n<h3> All submissions for this problem are available. <\/h3><p>Given an array A of length N, your task is to find the element which repeats in A maximum number of times as well as the corresponding count. In case of ties, choose the smaller element first.\n\n<h3>Input<\/h3>\n<\/p><p>First line of input contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases. Then follows description of T cases. Each case begins with a single integer N, the length of A. Then follow N space separated integers in next line.  Assume that 1 &lt;= T &lt;= 100, 1 &lt;= N &lt;= 100 and for all i in [1..N] : 1 &lt;= A[i] &lt;= 10000\n\n<h3>Output<\/h3>\n<\/p><p>For each test case, output two space separated integers V &amp; C. V is the value which occurs maximum number of times and C is its count.\n\n<h3>Example<\/h3>\n\n<pre>\n<b>Input:<\/b>\n2\n5\n1 2 3 2 5\n6\n1 2 2 1 1 2\n\n<b>Output:<\/b>\n2 2\n1 3\n\n<b>Description:<\/b>\nIn first case 2 occurs twice whereas all other elements occur only once. \nIn second case, both 1 and 2 occur 3 times but 1 is smaller than 2.\n<\/pre><\/p>    ","languages_supported":"NA","title":"MAXCOUNT","category":"NA","old_version":true,"problem_code":"MAXCOUNT"}

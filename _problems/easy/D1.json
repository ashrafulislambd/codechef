On the first day, he was challenged by his teacher with the following problem: given a number N, compute the product of its positive divisors. Johnny is desperate to impress his new teacher so he asks you for help.<\/p>\n<p>In this problem, the divisors of N do not include the number N itself. For example, if N=12, the divisors of N (excluding N) are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6. Thus, the product of divisors is 1x2x3x4x6=144. Since the result may be very large, if the result has more than 4 decimal digits, Johnny only needs to compute the <b>last 4 digits<\/b> of it.<\/p>\n<h3>Input<\/h3>\n<p>The first line contains t, the number of test cases (about 300,000). Then t test cases follow.<\/p>\n<p>Each test case contains a single integer N (1&lt;=N&lt;=500,000) whose product of divisors needs to be computed.<\/p>\n<h3>Output<\/h3>\n<p>For each test case, print a single line containing the corresponding result of that test case.<\/p>\n<h3>Example<\/h3>\n<pre><b>Input<\/b>\n6\n3\n4\n12\n25\n957\n10000\n\n<b>Output<\/b>\n1\n2\n144\n5\n7493\n0000\n<\/pre>\n<p><\/p>    ","languages_supported":"NA","title":"D1","category":"NA","old_version":true,"problem_code":"D1"}

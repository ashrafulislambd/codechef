You are a space merchant who earns by selling goods on these planets. Traveling to each planet requires you to pay for the fuel. The difficulty of traveling to $i$-th planet is $D_i$. You need to plan your trip by choosing a consecutive sub segment of planets.\n\nYour earning of the trip is calculated as follows -    \n- You earn $A$ coins for every planet you visit.\n- For each planet $i$ you visit, you have to pay $C_i$ coins for the fuel.\n- If you visit every planet with indices $L$ to $R$, you also have to pay $gap(L,R)$ coins where    \n$gap(L,R) = max [ (D_r - D_l)^2]$     $for L<=l<=r<=R$\n\nCalculate the maximum profit you can earn by traveling to a consecutive segment of planets. Note that if you travel to no planet at all, your net profit will be zero.\n\n###Input:\n\n- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.\n- For each testcase, the first line contains two integers $N$ and $A$\n- The next $N$ lines contains two integers $C_i, D_i$\n\n###Output:\nFor each testcase, output a single integer denoting the maximum profit you can earn.\n\n###Constraints\n- $1 \\leq T \\leq 10$\n- $1 \\leq N \\leq 3000$\n- $1 \\leq A \\leq 10^6$\n- $1 \\leq D_i, C_i \\leq 10^6$\n\n###Sample Input:  \n    1\n    3 10\n    1 3\n    3 1\n    2 2\n\n###Sample Output:\n    20\n    \n###EXPLANATION:\nFor L = 1 and R = 3, we have profit = (3 - 1 + 1) * 10 - (1 + 3 + 2) - (3 - 1)*(3 - 1) = 20. This is the maximum possible profit for any sub-segment.
